              "'{\\'filename\\': \\'rule_word2.docx\\', \\'text\\': \"ICC Men’s U19 Cricket World Cup 2024 Playing Conditions 1 Preamble - The Spirit of Cricket Cricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only according to the Laws (which are incorporated within these Playing Conditions), but also within the Spirit of Cricket. The major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains, but extends to all players, match officials and, especially in junior cricket, teachers, coaches and parents. Respect is central to the Spirit of Cricket. Respect your captain, team-mates, opponents and the authority of the umpires. Play hard and play fair. Accept the umpire’s decision. Create a positive atmosphere by your own conduct, and encourage others to do likewise. Show self-discipline, even when things go against you. Congratulate the opposition on their successes, and enjoy those of your own team. Thank the officials and your opposition at the end of the match, whatever the result. Cricket is an exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship and teamwork, which brings together people from different nationalities, cultures and religions, especially when played within the Spirit of Cricket. 1 THE PLAYERS 1.1 Number of players A match is played between two sides, each of eleven players, one of whom shall be captain. 1.2 Nomination and replacement of players 1.2.1 Each captain shall nominate 11 players plus a maximum of 4 substitute fielders in writing on the teamsheet provided by ICC . Other than set out in clause 1.2.7, no player (member of the playing eleven) may be changed after the nomination and prior to the start of play without the consent of the opposing captain. Immediately prior to the toss, the ICC Match Referee or his nominee shall check with both team captains that the players nominated on the team sheets are correct. 1.2.2 Only those nominated as substitute fielders shall be entitled to act as substitute fielders during the match, unless the ICC Match Referee, in exceptional circumstances, allows subsequent additions. 1.2.3 All those nominated including those nominated as substitute fielders, as well as any Concussion Replacements, must be official squad members of that particular team and by such nomination the nominees shall warrant that they are so eligible. 1.2.4 In addition, by their nomination, the nominees shall be deemed to have agreed to abide by all the applicable ICC Regulations pertaining to international cricket and in particular, the Clothing and Equipment Regulations, the Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel (hereafter referred to as the ICC Code of Conduct), the Anti- Discrimination Code for Players and Player Support Personnel, the AntiDoping Code and the Anti-Corruption Code. 1.2.5 A player or player support personnel who has been suspended from participating in a match shall not, from the toss of the coin and for the remainder of the match thereafter: 1.2.5.1 Be nominated as, or carry out any of the duties or responsibilities of a substitute fielder, or 1.2.5.2 Enter any part of the playing area (which shall include the field of play and the area between the boundary and the perimeter boards) at any time, including any scheduled or unscheduled breaks in play. 2 1.2.6 A player who has been suspended from participating in a match shall be permitted from the toss of the coin and for the remainder of the match thereafter be permitted to enter the players’ dressing room provided that the players’ dressing room (or any part thereof) for the match is not within the playing area described in clause 1.2.5.2 above (for example, the player is not permitted to enter the on-field ‘dug-out’). 1.2.7 Concussion Replacement 1.2.7.1 If a player sustains a concussion or suspected concussion as a result of a head or neck injury during the course of the relevant match, a Concussion Replacement may be permitted in the following circumstances: 1.2.7.1.1 the head or neck injury must have been sustained during play and within the playing area described in clause 1.2.5.2 above; 1.2.7.1.2 a concussion or suspected concussion must have been formally diagnosed by the Team Medical Representative; 1.2.7.1.3 the Team Medical Representative or Team Manager shall submit a Concussion Replacement Request to the ICC Match Referee on a standard form, which shall: 1.2.7.1.3.1 identify the player who has sustained the concussion or suspected concussion; 1.2.7.1.3.2 specify the incident in which the concussion or suspected concussion was sustained, including the time at which it occurred; 1.2.7.1.3.3 confirm that, following an examination, the Team Medical Representative believes or suspects that the player has sustained a concussion as a result of the incident specified in clause 1.2.7.1.3.2 above; and 1.2.7.1.3.4 identify the requested Concussion Replacement, who shall be a member of the official squad of the participating team and shall also be a like-for-like replacement for the player who has sustained the concussion or suspected concussion. If a like-for-like replacement is not available, the nearest like-for-like replacement from the official squad of the participating team may be submitted as the Concussion Replacement. 1.2.7.2 The Concussion Replacement Request must be submitted as soon as possible after the incident specified in clause 1.2.7.1.3.2 if a Concussion Replacement is to be permitted. 1.2.7.3 The ICC Match Referee should ordinarily approve a Concussion Replacement Request if the replacement is a like-for-like player (or the nearest like-for-like replacement as defined in 1.2.7.1.3.4 above) whose inclusion will not excessively advantage his team for the remainder of the match. 1.2.7.4 In assessing whether the nominated Concussion Replacement should be considered a like-for-like player, or nearest like-for-like player, the ICC Match Referee should consider the likely role the concussed player would have played during the remainder of the match, and the normal role that would be performed by the nominated Concussion Replacement. 1.2.7.5 If the ICC Match Referee believes that the inclusion of the nominated Concussion Replacement, when performing their normal role, would excessively advantage their team, the ICC Match Referee may impose such conditions upon the identity and involvement of the Concussion Replacement as he/she sees fit, in line with the overriding objective of facilitating a like-for-like replacement for the concussed player. For clarity, a concussion replacement will not be permitted to bowl during the innings and/or for the remainder of the match if the replaced player was suspended from bowling for any reason at the time they were replaced. 1.2.7.6 The ICC Match Referee may, in reviewing a Concussion Replacement Request made in accordance with clause 1.2.7.1.3, request any such further information as may be required in order to make the determination required under clauses 1.2.7.4 and 1.2.7.5. 1.2.7.7 The decision of the ICC Match Referee in relation to any Concussion Replacement Request shall be final and neither team shall have any right of appeal. 3 1.2.7.8 Once the Concussion Replacement has been approved by the ICC Match Referee, the replaced player shall play no further part in the match. 1.2.7.9 Both the Concussion Replacement and the replaced player shall be considered to have played in the match for records and statistical purposes. 1.3 Captain 1.3.1 If at any time the captain is not available, a deputy shall act for him. 1.3.2 If a captain is not available to nominate the players, then any person associated with that team may act as his deputy to do so. See clause1.2. 1.3.3 At any time after the nomination of the players, only a nominated player can act as deputy in discharging the duties and responsibilities of the captain as stated in these Playing Conditions, including at the toss. See clause 13.4 (The toss). 1.4 Responsibility of captains The captains are responsible at all times for ensuring that play is conducted within The Spirit of Cricket as well as within these Playing Conditions. 2 THE UMPIRES 2.1 Appointment and attendance The following rules for the selection and appointment of ODI umpires shall be followed as far as it is practicable to do so: 2.1.1 The umpires shall control the game as required by these Playing Conditions, with absolute impartiality and shall be present at the ground at least 1.5 hours before the scheduled start of play. 2.1.2 ICC shall appoint the two on-field umpires, a third umpire, and a fourth umpire to all matches. The fourth umpire shall act as the emergency on-field umpire. 2.1.3 The umpires shall not be from the same country as the participating teams and shall be selected from the ICC ‘International Panel’. In exceptional circumstances, the third or fourth umpire may be from the same country as one of the participating teams. 2.1.4 The ICC shall appoint the match referee for all matches who may or may not be present at the ground (ICC Match Referee). 2.1.2 Neither team shall have a right of objection to the appointment of any umpire or match referee. 2.2 Change of umpire An umpire shall not be changed during the match, other than in exceptional circumstances, unless he/she is injured or ill. 2.3 Consultation with Ground Authority Before the match the umpires shall consult with the Ground Authority to determine; 2.3.1 which clock or watch and back-up time piece is to be used during the match. 2.3.2 the boundary of the field of play. See clause 19 (Boundaries). 2.3.3 the use of covers. See clause 10 (Covering the pitch). 4 2.3.4 any special conditions of play affecting the conduct of the match. inform the scorers of agreements in 2.3.1, Error! Reference source not found., and 2.3.2. 2.4 The wickets, creases and boundaries Before the toss and during the match, the umpires shall satisfy themselves that 2.4.1 the creases are correctly marked. See clause 7 (The creases). 2.4.2 the wickets are properly pitched. See clause 8 (The wickets) 2.4.3 the boundary of the field of play complies with the requirements of clauses 19.1 (Determining the boundary of the field of play), 19.2 (Identifying and marking the boundary) and 19.3 (Restoring the boundary). 2.5 Conduct of the match, implements and equipment Before the toss and during the match, the umpires shall satisfy themselves that 2.5.1 the conduct of the match is strictly in accordance with these Playing Conditions. 2.5.2 the implements used in the match conform to the following 2.5.2.1 clause 4 (The ball). 2.5.2.2 externally visible requirements of clause 5 (The bat) and paragraph 1 of Appendix B 2.5.2.3 either clauses 8.2 (Size of stumps) and 8.3 (The bails). 2.5.3 no player uses equipment other than that permitted. See paragraph 2 of Appendix A. Note particularly therein the interpretation of ‘protective helmet’. 2.5.4 the wicket-keeper’s gloves comply with the requirements of clause 27.2 (Gloves). 2.6 Fair and unfair play The umpires shall be the sole judges of fair and unfair play. 2.7 Fitness for play 2.7.1 It is solely for the umpires together to decide whether either conditions of ground, weather or light or exceptional circumstances mean that it would be dangerous or unreasonable for play to take place. Conditions shall not be regarded as either dangerous or unreasonable merely because they are not ideal. The fact that the grass and the ball are wet does not warrant the ground conditions being regarded as unreasonable or dangerous. 2.7.2 Conditions shall be regarded as dangerous if there is actual and foreseeable risk to the safety of any player or umpire. 2.7.3 Conditions shall be regarded as unreasonable if, although posing no risk to safety, it would not be sensible for play to proceed. 2.7.4 If the umpires consider the ground is so wet or slippery as to deprive the bowler of a reasonable foothold, the fielders of the power of free movement, or the batters of the ability to play their strokes or to run between the wickets, then these conditions shall be regarded as so bad that it would be dangerous and unreasonable for play to take place. 2.8 Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable circumstances 2.8.1 All references to ground include the pitch. See clause 6.1 (Area of pitch). 5 2.8.2 If at any time the umpires together agree that the conditions of ground, weather or light, or any other circumstances are dangerous or unreasonable, they shall immediately suspend play, or not allow play to start or to recommence. The decision as to whether conditions are so bad as to warrant such action is one for the umpires alone to make, following consultation with the ICC Match Referee. 2.8.3 If circumstances are warranted, the umpires shall stop play and instruct the Ground Authority to take whatever action they can and use whatever equipment is necessary to remove as much dew as possible from the outfield when conditions become unreasonable or dangerous. The umpires may also instruct the ground staff to take such action during scheduled and unscheduled breaks in play. 2.8.4 The umpires shall disregard any shadow on the pitch from the stadium or from any permanent object on the ground. 2.8.5 Light Meters It is the responsibility of the ICC to supply light meters to the match officials to be used in accordance with these playing conditions. 2.8.5.1 All light meters shall be uniformly calibrated. 2.8.5.2 The umpires shall be entitled to use light meter readings as a guideline for determining whether the light is fit for play in accordance with the criteria set out in clause 2.8.2 above. 2.8.5.3 Light meter readings may accordingly be used by the umpires: 2.8.5.3.1 To determine whether there has been at any stage a deterioration or improvement in the light. 2.8.5.3.2 As benchmarks for the remainder of a match. 2.8.6 Use of artificial lights If in the opinion of the umpires, natural light is deteriorating to an unfit level, they shall authorize the Ground Authority to use the available artificial lighting so that the match can commence or continue in acceptable conditions. In the event of power failure or lights malfunction, the provisions relating to the delay or interruption of play due to bad weather or light shall apply. 2.8.7 When there is a suspension of play it is the responsibility of the umpires to monitor conditions. They shall make inspections as often as appropriate, unaccompanied by any players or officials. Immediately the umpires together agree that the conditions are no longer dangerous or unreasonable they shall call upon the players to resume play. 2.8.8 The safety of all persons within the ground is of paramount importance to the ICC. In the event that of any threatening circumstance, whether actual or perceived (including for example weather, pitch invasions, act of God, etc.), then the umpires, on the advice of the ICC Match Referee, should suspend play and all players and officials should immediately be asked to leave the field of play in a safe and orderly manner and to relocate to a secure and safe area (depending on each particular threat) pending the satisfactory passing or resolution of such threat or risk to the reasonable satisfaction of the umpires, the ICC Match Referee, the head of the relevant Ground Authority, the head of ground security and/or the police as the circumstances may require. 2.8.9 Where play is suspended under clause 2.8.8 above the decision to abandon or resume play shall be the responsibility of the ICC Match Referee who shall act only after consultation with the head of ground security and the police. 2.9 Position of umpires The umpires shall stand where they can best see any act upon which their decision may be required. Subject to this over-riding consideration, the bowler’s end umpire shall stand in a position so as not to interfere with either the bowler’s run-up or the striker’s view. 6 The striker’s end umpire may elect to stand on the off side instead of the on side of the pitch, provided he/she informs the captain of the fielding side, the striker and the other umpire. 2.10 Umpires changing ends Shall not apply. 2.11 Disagreement and dispute Where there is disagreement or dispute about any matter, the umpires together shall make the final decision. See also clause 31.6 (Consultation by umpires). 2.12 Umpire’s decision An umpire may alter any decision provided that such alteration is made promptly and does not contradict clause 20.6 (Dead ball not to be revoked). This apart, an umpire’s decision, once made, is final. 2.13 Signals 2.13.1 The following code of signals shall be used by umpires. 2.13.1.1 Signals made while the ball is in play No ball - by extending one arm horizontally. Out - by raising an index finger above the head. (If not out, the umpire shall call Not out.) Wide - by extending both arms horizontally. Dead ball - by crossing and re-crossing the wrists below the waist. 2.13.1.2 When the ball is dead, the bowler’s end umpire shall repeat the signals in clause 2.13.1.1, with the exception of the signal for Out, to the scorers. 2.13.1.3 The signals listed below shall be made to the scorers only when the ball is dead. Boundary 4 - by waving an arm from side to side finishing with the arm across the chest Boundary 6 - by raising both arms above the head. Bye - by raising an open hand above the head. Five Penalty runs awarded to the batting side - by repeated tapping of one shoulder with the opposite hand. Five Penalty runs awarded to the fielding side - by placing one hand on the opposite shoulder. Leg bye - by touching a raised knee with the hand. Revoke last signal - by touching both shoulders, each with the opposite hand. Short run - by bending one arm upwards and touching the nearer shoulder with the tips of the fingers. Free Hit – after signaling the No ball, the bowler’s end umpire extends one arm straight upwards and moves it in a circular motion. Powerplay Over – by rotating his arm in a large circle. The following signal is for Level 4 player conduct offences. The signal has two parts, both of which should be acknowledged separately by the scorers. Level 4 conduct Part 1 - by putting one arm out to the side of the body and repeatedly raising it and lowering it. Part 2 - by raising an index finger, held at shoulder height, to the side of the body. 2.13.1.4 All the signals in clause 2.13.1.3 are to be made by the bowler’s end umpire except that for Short run, which is to be signalled by the umpire at the end where short running occurs. However, the 7 bowler’s end umpire shall be responsible both for the final signal of Short run to the scorers and, if more than one run is short, for informing them as to the number of runs to be recorded. 2.13.2 The umpire shall wait until each signal to the scorers has been separately acknowledged by a scorer before allowing play to proceed. If several signals are to be used, they should be given in the order that the events occurred. 2.14 Informing the umpires Wherever the umpires are to receive information from captains or other players under these Playing Conditions, it will be sufficient for one umpire to be so informed and for him/her to inform the other umpire. 2.15 Correctness of scores Consultation between umpires and scorers on doubtful points is essential. The umpires shall, throughout the match, satisfy themselves as to the correctness of the number of runs scored, the wickets that have fallen and, where appropriate, the number of overs bowled. The umpires shall ensure that they are able to contact the scorers at any time during the match and at its conclusion to address any issues relating to the correctness of scores. 3 THE SCORERS 3.1 Appointment of scorers Two scorers shall be appointed to record all runs scored, all wickets taken and, where appropriate, number of overs bowled. 3.2 Correctness of scores The scorers shall frequently check to ensure that their records agree and consult with the umpires if necessary. See clause 2.15 (Correctness of scores). 3.3 Acknowledging signals The scorers shall accept all instructions and signals given to them by the umpires and shall immediately acknowledge each separate signal. 4 THE BALL 4.1 Weight and size The ball, when new, shall weigh not less than 5.5 ounces/155.9 g, nor more than 5.75 ounces/163 g, and shall measure not less than 8.81 in/22.4 cm, nor more than 9 in/22.9 cm in circumference. 4.2 Approval and control of balls 4.2.1 White Kookaburra ‘Turf’ cricket balls supplied by ICC will be used in all matches. Spare balls of the same brand will be supplied for changing during a match. 4.2.2 The fielding captain or his nominee may select the ball with which he wishes to bowl from the supply provided. The third or fourth umpire shall take a box containing at least 6 new balls to the dressing room and supervise the selection of the ball. 4.2.3 The umpires shall retain possession of the match ball(s) throughout the duration of the match when play is not actually taking place. 4.2.4 During play umpires shall periodically and irregularly inspect the condition of the ball and shall retain possession of it at the fall of a wicket, a drinks interval, or any other disruption in play. 8 4.3 New ball 4.3.1 Each fielding team shall have two new balls for its innings, to be used in alternate overs i.e. one from each end. 4.3.2 In a match reduced to 25 overs or less per side before the first innings commences, each team shall have only one new ball for its Innings. 4.4 Ball lost or becoming unfit for play If, during play, the ball cannot be found or recovered or the umpires agree that it has become unfit for play through normal use, the umpires shall replace it with a ball which has had wear comparable with that which the previous ball had received before the need for its replacement. When the ball is replaced, the umpire shall inform the batters and the fielding captain. 5 THE BAT 5.1 The bat 5.1.1 The bat consists of two parts, a handle and a blade. 5.1.2 The basic requirements and measurements of the bat are set out in this clause with detailed specifications in paragraph 1 of Appendix B. 5.2 The handle 5.2.1 The handle is to be made principally of cane and/or wood. 5.2.2 The part of the handle that is wholly outside the blade is defined to be the upper portion of the handle. It is a straight shaft for holding the bat. 5.2.3 The upper portion of the handle may be covered with a grip as defined in paragraph 1.2.2 of Appendix B. 5.3 The blade 5.3.1 The blade comprises the whole of the bat apart from the handle as defined in clause 5.2 and in paragraph 1.3 of Appendix B. 5.3.2 The blade shall consist solely of wood. 5.4 Protection and repair Subject to the specifications in paragraph 1.4 of Appendix B. and providing clause 5.5 is not contravened, 5.4.1 solely for the purposes of either protection from surface damage to the face, sides and shoulders of the blade or repair to the blade after surface damage, material that is not rigid, either at the time of its application to the blade or subsequently, may be placed on these surfaces. 5.4.2 for repair of the blade after damage other than surface damage 5.4.2.1 solid material may be inserted into the blade. 5.4.2.2 The only material permitted for any insertion is wood with minimal essential adhesives. 5.4.3 to prevent damage to the toe, material may be placed on that part of the blade but shall not extend over any part of the face, back or sides of the blade. 9 5.5 Damage to the ball 5.5.1 For any part of the bat, covered or uncovered, the hardness of the constituent materials and the surface texture thereof shall not be such that either or both could cause unacceptable damage to the ball. 5.5.2 Any material placed on any part of the bat, for whatever purpose, shall similarly not be such that it could cause unacceptable damage to the ball. 5.5.3 For the purpose of this clause, unacceptable damage is any change that is greater than normal wear and tear caused by the ball striking the uncovered wooden surface of the blade. 5.6 Contact with the ball In these clauses, 5.6.1 reference to the bat shall imply that the bat is held in the batter’s hand or a glove worn on his hand, unless stated otherwise. 5.6.2 contact between the ball and any of 5.6.2.1 to 5.6.2.4 5.6.2.1 the bat itself 5.6.2.2 the batter’s hand holding the bat 5.6.2.3 any part of a glove worn on the batter’s hand holding the bat 5.6.2.4 any additional materials permitted under 5.4 shall be regarded as the ball striking or touching the bat or being struck by the bat. 5.7 Bat size limits 5.7.1 The overall length of the bat, when the lower portion of the handle is inserted, shall not be more than 38 in/96.52 cm. 5.7.2 The blade of the bat shall not exceed the following dimensions: Width: 4.25in / 10.8 cm Depth: 2.64in / 6.7 cm Edges: 1.56in / 4.0cm. Furthermore, it should also be able to pass through a bat gauge as described in paragraph 1.6 of Appendix B. 5.7.3 The handle shall not exceed 52% of the overall length of the bat. 5.7.4 The material permitted for covering the blade in clause 5.4.1 shall not exceed 0.04 in/0.1 cm in thickness. 5.7.5 The maximum permitted thickness of protective material placed on the toe of the blade is 0.12 in/0.3 cm. 5.8 Categories of bat 5.8.1 Type A bats conform to clauses 5.1 to 5.7 inclusive. 5.8.2 Only Type A bats may be used in all matches. 10 6 THE PITCH 6.1 Area of pitch The pitch is a rectangular area of the ground 22 yards/20.12 m in length and 10 ft/3.05 m in width. It is bounded at either end by the bowling creases and on either side by imaginary lines, one each side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps, each parallel to it and 5 ft/1.52 m from it. If the pitch is next to an artificial pitch which is closer than 5 ft/1.52 m from the middle stumps, the pitch on that side will extend only to the junction of the two surfaces. See clauses 8.1 (Description, width and pitching), 7.2 (The bowling crease) and Appendix C. 6.2 Fitness of pitch for play The umpires shall be the sole judges of the fitness of the pitch for play. See clauses 2.7 (Fitness for play) and 2.8 (Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable conditions). 6.3 Selection and preparation Before the match, the Ground Authority shall be responsible for the selection and preparation of the pitch. During the match, the umpires shall control its use and maintenance. 6.3.1 The Ground Authority shall ensure that during the period prior to the start of play and during intervals, the pitch area shall be roped off so as to prevent unauthorised access. (The pitch area shall include an area at least 2 metres beyond the rectangle made by the crease markings at both ends of the pitch). 6.3.2 The fourth umpire shall ensure that, prior to the start of play and during any intervals, only authorised staff, the ICC match officials, players, team coaches and authorised television personnel shall be allowed access to the pitch area. Such access shall be subject to the following limitations: 6.3.2.1 Only captains and team coaches may walk on the actual playing surface of the pitch area (outside of the crease markings). 6.3.2.2 Access to the pitch area by television personnel shall be restricted to one camera crew (including one or two television commentators) of the official licensed television broadcaster(s) (but not news crews). 6.3.2.3 No spiked footwear shall be permitted. 6.3.2.4 No one shall be permitted to bounce a ball on the pitch, strike it with a bat or cause damage to the pitch in any other way. 6.3.2.5 Access shall not interfere with pitch preparation. 6.3.3 In the event of any dispute, the ICC Match Referee will rule and his ruling will be final. 6.4 Changing the pitch 6.4.1 If the on-field umpires decide that it is dangerous or unreasonable for play to continue on the match pitch, they shall stop play and immediately advise the ICC Match Referee. 6.4.2 The on-field umpires and the ICC Match Referee shall then consult with both captains. 6.4.3 If the captains agree to continue, play shall resume. 6.4.4 If the decision is not to resume play, the on-field umpires together with the ICC Match Referee shall consider whether the existing pitch can be repaired and the match resumed from the point it was stopped. In considering whether to authorise such repairs, the ICC Match Referee must consider whether this would place either side at an unfair advantage, given the play that had already taken place on the dangerous pitch. 6.4.5 If the decision is that the existing pitch cannot be repaired, then the match is to be abandoned with the following consequences: 6.4.5.1 In the event of the required number of overs to constitute a match having been completed at the time the match is abandoned, the result shall be determined according to the provisions of clause 16.4.2. 11 6.4.5.2 In the event of the required number of overs to constitute a match not having been completed, the match will be abandoned as a no result. 6.4.6 If the abandonment occurs on the day of the match, the ICC Match Referee shall consult with the Event Technical Committee with the objective of finding a way for a new match (including a new nomination of teams and toss) to commence on the same date and venue. Such a match may be played either on the repaired pitch or on another pitch, subject to the ICC Match Referee and the relevant Ground Authority both being satisfied that the new pitch will be of the required standard. The playing time lost between the scheduled start time of the original match and the actual start time of the new match will be covered by the provisions of clause 12. 6.4.7 If it is not possible to start a new match on the scheduled day of the match, (including any reserve day), the match will be abandoned (no result). 6.4.8 Throughout the above decision making processes, the ICC Match Referee shall keep informed both captains and the head of the Ground Authority. The head of the Ground Authority shall ensure that suitable and prompt public announcements are made. 6.5 Non-turf pitches All matches shall be played on natural turf pitches. Note: Prior to the commencement of the series the participating Member Boards may agree to, and then seek the approval of, ICC to use a hybrid pitch as an alternate to a natural turf pitch. The use of PVA and other adhesives in the preparation of pitches is not permitted. 6.6 Junior Cricket Shall not apply. 7 THE CREASES 7.1 The creases The positions of a bowling crease, a popping crease and two return creases shall be marked by white lines, as set out in clauses 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4, at each end of the pitch. See paragraph 1 of Appendix C. 7.2 The bowling crease The bowling crease, which is the back edge of the crease marking, is the line that marks the end of the pitch, as in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch). It shall be 8 ft 8 in/2.64 m in length. 7.3 The popping crease The popping crease, which is the back edge of the crease marking, shall be in front of and parallel to the bowling crease and shall be 4 ft/1.22 m from it. The popping crease shall be marked to a minimum of 15 yards/13.71 m on either side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps and shall be considered to be unlimited in length. 7.4 The return creases The return creases, which are the inside edges of the crease markings, shall be at right angles to the popping crease at a distance of 4 ft 4 in/1.32 m either side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps. Each return crease shall be marked from the popping crease to a minimum of 8 ft/2.44 m behind it and shall be considered to be unlimited in length. 7.5 Additional Crease Markings As a guideline to the umpires for the calling of Wides on the offside, the crease markings detailed in paragraph 1 of Appendix C may be marked in white at each end of the pitch. 12 8 THE WICKETS 8.1 Description, width and pitching Two sets of wickets shall be pitched opposite and parallel to each other in the centres of the bowling creases. Each set shall be 9 in/22.86 cm wide and shall consist of three wooden stumps with two wooden bails on top. See paragraph 2 of Appendix B. 8.2 Size of stumps The tops of the stumps shall be 28 in/71.12 cm above the playing surface and shall be dome shaped except for the bail grooves. The portion of a stump above the playing surface shall be cylindrical apart from the domed top, with circular section of diameter not less than 1.38 in/3.50 cm nor more than 1.5 in/3.81 cm. See paragraph 2 of Appendix B. For televised matches the broadcaster may provide a slightly larger cylindrical stump to accommodate the stump camera. When the larger stump is used, all three stumps must be exactly the same size. 8.3 The bails 8.3.1 The bails, when in position on top of the stumps, - shall not project more than 0.5 in/1.27 cm above them. - shall fit between the stumps without forcing them out of the vertical. 8.3.2 Each bail shall conform to the following specifications. See paragraph 2 of Appendix B. Overall length 4.31 in/10.95 cm Length of barrel 2.13 in /5.40 cm Longer spigot 1.38 in/3.50 cm Shorter spigot 0.81 in/2.06 cm. 8.3.3 The two spigots and the barrel shall have the same centre line. 8.3.4 Devices aimed at protecting player safety by limiting the distance that a bail can travel off the stumps will be allowed, subject to the approval of the ICC. 8.4 Dispensing with bails The umpires may agree to dispense with the use of bails, if necessary. If they so agree then no bails shall be used at either end. The use of bails shall be resumed as soon as conditions permit. See clause 29.5 (Dispensing with bails). 8.5 LED Wickets LED Wickets will not be used. 9 PREPARATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE PLAYING AREA 9.1 Rolling The pitch shall not be rolled during the match except as permitted in clauses 9.1.1 and 9.1.2. 9.1.1 Frequency and duration of rolling During the match the pitch may be rolled at the request of the captain of the side batting second, for a period of not more than 7 minutes, before the start of the second innings. 13 9.1.2 Rolling after a delayed start In addition to the rolling permitted above, if, after the toss and before the first innings of the match, the start is delayed, the captain of the batting side may request that the pitch be rolled for not more than 7 minutes. However, if the umpires together agree that the delay has had no significant effect on the state of the pitch, they shall refuse such request for rolling of the pitch. 9.1.3 Choice of rollers If there is more than one roller available the captain of the batting side shall choose which one is to be used. The following shall apply in addition to clause 9.1: 9.1.4 Prior to the scheduled time for the toss, the artificial drying of the pitch and outfield shall be at the discretion of the Ground Authority. Thereafter and throughout the match the drying of the outfield may be undertaken at any time by the Ground Authority, but the drying of the affected area of the pitch shall be carried out only on the instructions and under the supervision of the umpires. The umpires shall be empowered to have the pitch dried without reference to the captains at any time they are of the opinion that it is unfit for play. 9.1.5 The umpires may instruct the Ground Authority to use any available equipment, including any roller for the purpose of drying the pitch and making it fit for play. 9.1.6 An absorbent roller may be used to remove water from the covers including the cover on the match pitch. 9.2 Clearing debris from the pitch 9.2.1 The pitch shall be cleared of any debris 9.2.1.1 between innings. This shall precede rolling if any is to take place. 9.2.1.2 at all intervals for meals. 9.2.2 The clearance of debris in clause 9.2.1 shall be done by sweeping, except where the umpires consider that this may be detrimental to the surface of the pitch. In this case the debris must be cleared from that area by hand, without sweeping. 9.2.3 In addition to 9.2.1, debris may be cleared from the pitch by hand, without sweeping, before mowing and whenever either umpire considers it necessary. 9.3 Mowing 9.3.1 Responsibility for mowing 9.3.1.1 All mowings which are carried out before the match shall be the sole responsibility of the Ground Authority. 9.4 Watering the pitch The pitch shall not be watered during the match. 9.5 Re-marking creases Creases shall be re-marked whenever either umpire considers it necessary. 9.6 Maintenance of footholes The umpires shall ensure that the holes made by the bowlers and batters are cleaned out and dried whenever necessary to facilitate play. The umpires shall allow, if necessary, the returfing of footholes made by the bowlers in their delivery strides, or the use of quick-setting fillings for the same purpose. In addition, the umpires shall see that wherever possible and whenever it is considered necessary, action is taken during all intervals in play to do whatever is practicable to improve the bowler’s footholes. 14 9.7 Securing of footholds and maintenance of pitch During play, umpires shall allow the players to secure their footholds by the use of sawdust provided that no damage to the pitch is caused and that clause 41 (Unfair play) is not contravened. 9.8 Protection and preparation of adjacent pitches during matches The protection (by way of an appropriate cover) and preparation of pitches which are adjacent to the match pitch will be permitted during the match subject to the following: 9.8.1 Such measures will only be possible if requested by the Ground Authority and approved by the umpires before the start of the match. 9.8.2 Approval should only be granted where such measures are unavoidable and will not compromise the safety of the players or their ability to execute their actions with complete freedom. 9.8.3 The preparation work shall be carried out under the supervision of the fourth umpire. 9.8.4 The consent of the captains is not required but the umpires shall advise both captains and the ICC Match Referee before the start of the match on what has been agreed. 10 COVERING THE PITCH 10.1 Before the match The use of covers before the match is the responsibility of the Ground Authority and may include full covering if required. The pitch shall be entirely protected against rain up to the commencement of play. However, the Ground Authority shall grant suitable facility to the captains to inspect the pitch before the nomination of their players and to the umpires to discharge their duties as laid down in clauses 2 (The umpires), 6 (The pitch), 7 (The creases), 8 (The wickets), and 9 (Preparation and maintenance of the playing area). 10.2 During the match The pitch shall be entirely protected against rain up to the commencement of play, and for the duration of the period of the match. The covers must totally protect the pitch and also the pitch surroundings, to a minimum of 5 metres either side of the pitch, and any worn or soft areas in the outfield. The bowlers’ run-ups shall be covered during inclement weather, in order to keep them dry, to a distance of at least 10 x 10 metres. 10.3 Removal of covers All covers (including “hessian” or “scrim” covers used to protect the pitch against the sun) shall be removed not later than 2 ½ hours before the scheduled start of play provided it is not raining at the time, but the pitch will be covered again if rain falls prior to the commencement of play. 11 INTERVALS 11.1 An interval 11.1.1 The following shall be classed as intervals. - Intervals between innings. - Intervals for meals. 15 - Intervals for drinks. - Any other agreed interval. 11.1.2 Only these intervals shall be considered as scheduled breaks for the purposes of clause 24.2.6 (fielder absent or leaving the field of play). 11.2 Duration of interval 11.2.1 There shall be a 30 minute interval between innings, taken from the call of Time before the interval until the call of Play on resumption after the interval. 11.3 Allowance for interval between innings Law 11.3 of the Laws of Cricket shall not apply. 11.4 Changing agreed times of intervals 11.4.1 If the innings of the team batting first is completed prior to the scheduled time for the interval, the interval shall take place immediately and the innings of the team batting second will commence after the interval. Note: The prescribed interval timings above may be reduced by the ICC Match Referee taking into account the intention of not having a prolonged interval after a lengthy interruption close to the conclusion of the innings of the team batting first. However, the minimum interval shall not be less than 10 minutes. 11.5 Intervals for drinks 11.5.1 Two drinks breaks per session shall be permitted, each 1 hour 10 minutes apart. Under conditions of extreme heat the umpires may permit extra intervals for drinks. 11.5.2 An individual player may be given a drink either on the boundary edge or at the fall of a wicket, on the field, provided that no playing time is wasted.

Once notified, the decision cannot be changed. 13.6 Duration of Match 13.6.1 All matches will consist of one innings per side, each innings being limited to a maximum of 50 overs. 13.6.2 All matches shall be of one day’s scheduled duration. 13.6.3 The Semi-Finals and the Final shall have a reserve day allocated on which an incomplete match shall be continued from the scheduled day. No other matches shall have a reserve day allocated. 13.6.4 If the reserve day is allocated to the Semi-Finals or the Final, every effort will be made to complete the match on the scheduled day with any necessary reduction in overs taking place and only if the minimum number of overs necessary to constitute a match cannot be bowled on the scheduled day will the match be completed on the reserve day. 13.6.3.5 If the match has started on the scheduled day and overs are subsequently reduced following an interruption, but no further play is possible, the match will resume on the reserve day at the point where the last ball was played. Refer Appendix F. 13.7 Length of Innings 13.7.1 Uninterrupted Matches. 13.7.1.1 Each team shall bat for 50 overs unless all out earlier. 13.7.1.2 If the team fielding first fails to bowl the required number of overs by the scheduled time for cessation of the first innings, play shall continue until the required number of overs has been bowled. Subject to clause 11.4, the interval shall be fixed at 30 minutes. The team batting second shall receive its full quota of 50 overs irrespective of the number of overs it bowled in the scheduled time for the cessation of the first innings. 13.7.1.3 If the team batting first is dismissed in less than 50 overs, the team batting second shall be entitled to bat for 50 overs. 13.7.1.4 If the team fielding second fails to bowl 50 overs by the scheduled cessation time, the hours of play shall be extended until the required number of overs has been bowled or a result is achieved. 18 13.7.1.5 Penalties shall apply for slow over rates (refer to the ICC Code of Conduct). 13.7.2 Delayed or Interrupted Matches 13.7.2.1 Delay or Interruption to the Innings of the Team Batting First (see paragraph 1 of Appendix E) 13.7.2.1.1 When playing time has been lost the revised number of overs to be bowled in the match shall be based on a rate of 14.28 overs per hour, which is inclusive of the provision of drinks intervals, in the total remaining time available for play. 13.7.2.1.2 The revision of the number of overs should ensure, whenever possible, that both teams have the opportunity of batting for the same number of overs. The team batting second shall not bat for a greater number of overs than the first team unless the latter completed its innings in less than its allocated overs. To constitute a match, a minimum of 20 overs (25 overs for the Semi-Finals and the Final) have to be bowled to the side batting second, subject to a result not being achieved earlier. 13.7.2.1.3 As soon as the total minutes of playing time remaining is less than the completed overs faced by Team 1 multiplied by 4.2, then the first innings is terminated and the provisions of 13.7.2.2 below take effect. 13.7.2.1.4 A fixed time will be specified for the commencement of the interval, and also the close of play for the match, by applying a rate of 14.28 overs per hour. When calculating the length of playing time available for the match, or the length of either innings, the timing and duration of all relative delays, extensions in playing hours, interruptions in play, and intervals, excluding those for drinks, will be taken into consideration. This calculation must not cause the match to finish earlier than the original or rescheduled time for cessation of play on the final scheduled day for play. If required the original time shall be extended to allow for one extra over for each team. 13.7.2.1.5 If the team fielding first fails to bowl the revised number of overs by the specified time, play shall continue until the required number of overs have been bowled or the innings is completed. 13.7.2.1.6 Penalties shall apply for slow over rates (refer to the ICC Code of Conduct). 13.7.2.2 Delay or Interruption to the innings of the Team Batting Second (see paragraph 2 of Appendix E) 13.7.2.2.1 When playing time has been lost and, as a result, it is not possible for the team batting second to have the opportunity of receiving its allocated, or revised allocation of overs in the playing time available, the number of overs shall be reduced at a rate of 14.28 overs per hour, which is inclusive of the provision of drinks intervals, in respect of the lost playing time. Should the calculations result in a fraction of an over the fraction shall be ignored. 13.7.2.2.2 In addition, should the innings of the team batting first have been completed prior to the scheduled, or re-scheduled time for the commencement of the interval, then any calculation relating to the revision of overs shall not be effective until an amount of time equivalent to that by which the second innings started early has elapsed. 13.7.2.2.3 To constitute a match, a minimum of 20 overs (25 overs for the Semi-Finals and the Final) have to be bowled to the team batting second subject to a result not being achieved earlier. 13.7.2.2.4 The team batting second shall not bat for a greater number of overs than the first team unless the latter completed its innings in less than its allocated overs. 13.7.2.2.5 A fixed time will be specified for the close of play by applying a rate of 14.28 overs per hour. With the exception of drinks intervals, the timing and duration of all relative delays, extensions in playing hours and interruptions in play, will be taken into consideration in specifying this time. 13.7.2.2.6 If the team fielding second fails to bowl the revised overs by the scheduled or rescheduled close of play, the hours of play shall be extended until the overs have been bowled or a result achieved. 19 13.7.2.2.7 Penalties shall apply for slow over rates (refer to the ICC Code of Conduct). 13.7.3 Extra Time There shall be 30 minutes of extra time allocated to all matches. 13.8 Over-Rate Penalties 13.8.1 The fielding side shall be in position to bowl the first ball of the final over of the innings by the scheduled (or re-scheduled) cessation time for the innings (calculated in accordance with clause 13.7). In delayed or interrupted matches where there has been a reduction of 3 or more overs pursuant to clause 13.7.2, the fielding side shall be in position to bowl the first ball of the penultimate over of the innings by the scheduled (or re-scheduled) cessation time for the innings. 13.8.2 Where this requirement is not met, clause 28.7.2.2.3 shall be varied and from the start of the next over after the point in time at which the cessation time is reached (and for the remainder of the innings) no more than 4 fielders shall be permitted outside the fielding restriction area referred to in clause 28.7.2.1. 13.8.3 Clause 13.8.2 shall not apply where: 13.8.3.1 a side’s innings is reduced to less than 25 overs, unless the over-rate penalty has been applied prior to such reduction; or 13.8.3.2 a side’s innings is completed prior to the scheduled (or re-scheduled) cessation time for the innings. 13.8.4 The bowler’s end umpire shall inform the captain of the fielding side, the batter and the other umpire of: 13.8.4.1 the scheduled cessation time for the innings prior to the start of the innings, and of any re-scheduled cessation time following any subsequent interruption to play; and 13.8.4.2 any time allowances pursuant to clause 12.8.3 as and when they arise. 13.8.5 Over-rate penalties pursuant to clause 13.8 shall be applied in addition to the relevant provisions under the ICC Code of Conduct. 13.8 Number of Overs per Bowler 13.8.1 No bowler shall bowl more than 10 overs in an innings. 13.8.2 In a delayed or interrupted match where the overs are reduced for both teams or for the team bowling second, no bowler may bowl more than one-fifth of the total overs allowed. 13.8.3 Where the total overs is not divisible by 5, one additional over shall be allowed to the maximum number per bowler necessary to make up the balance. 13.8.4 In the event of a bowler breaking down and being unable to complete an over, the remaining balls will be allowed by another bowler. Such part of an over will count as a full over only in so far as each bowler’s limit is concerned. 13.8.5 The scoreboard shall show the total number of overs bowled and the number of overs bowled by each bowler. 14 THE FOLLOW-ON Shall not apply. 15 DECLARATION AND FORFEITURE Shall not apply. 20 16 THE RESULT 16.1 A Win – one-innings match 16.1.1 Unless the winner is determined by DLS (see clause 16.4), the side which has scored in its one innings a total of runs in excess of that scored by the opposing side in its one completed innings shall win the match. See clause 13.3 (Completed innings). Note also clause 16.5 (Winning hit or extras). 16.1.2 Save for circumstances where a match is awarded to a team as a consequence of the opposing team’s refusal to play (clause 16.2), a result can be achieved only if both teams have had the opportunity of batting for at least 20 overs (25 overs for the Semi-Finals and the Final), unless one team has been all out in less than 20 overs (25 overs for the Semi-Finals and the Final), or unless the team batting second scores enough runs to win in less than 20 overs. 16.1.3 Save for circumstances where a match is awarded to a team as a consequence of the opposing team’s refusal to play (clause 16.2), all matches in which both teams have not had an opportunity of batting for a minimum of 20 overs (25 overs for the Semi-Finals and the Final), shall be declared a No Result. 16.2 ICC Match Referee awarding a match 16.2.1 A match shall be lost by a side which either 16.2.1.1 concedes defeat or 16.2.1.2 in the opinion of the ICC Match Referee refuses to play and the ICC Match Referee shall award the match to the other side. 16.2.2 16.2.1.3 refuses to play in a rescheduled match.If an umpire considers that an action by any player or players might constitute a refusal by either side to play then the umpires together shall inform the ICC Match Referee of this fact. The ICC Match Referee shall together with the umpires ascertain the cause of the action. If the ICC Match Referee, after due consultation with the umpires, then decides that this action does constitute a refusal to play by one side, he/she shall so inform the captain of that side. If the captain persists in the action the ICC Match Referee shall award the match in accordance with clause 16.2.1.2 above. 16.2.3 If action as in clause 16.2.2 above takes place after play has started and does not constitute a refusal to play the delay or interruption in play shall be dealt with in the same manner as provided for in clauses 13.7.2 (Delayed and Interrupted Matches) and 11.4 (Changing agreed times for intervals) above. Note: In addition to the consequences of any refusal to play prescribed under this clause, any such refusal, whether temporary or final, may result in disciplinary action being taken against the captain and team responsible under the ICC Code of Conduct. 16.3 All other matches – A Tie or No Result 16.3.1 A Tie 16.3.1.1 If the teams’ scores are equal after both innings have been completed (if applicable under DLS – see clause 16.4), then a Super Over shall be played. If the Super Over is a tie, then unless exceptional circumstances arise (see paragraph 25 of Appendix G) subsequent Super Overs shall be played until there is a winner. Should it not be possible to play or to complete the Super Overs needed to determine a winner, the match shall be tied. 16.3.2 No Result 16.3.2.1 See clause 16.1.3 above. 16.4 Calculation of the Target Score 16.4.1 Interrupted Matches 16.4.1.1 If, due to suspension of play after the start of the match, the number of overs in the innings of either team has to be revised to a lesser number than originally allotted (minimum of 20 overs (25 overs for the Semi-Finals and the Final),), then a revised target score (to win) should be set for the 21 number of overs which the team batting second will have the opportunity of facing. This revised target is to be calculated using DLS. The target set will always be a whole number and one run less will constitute a Tie. 16.4.2 Prematurely Terminated Matches 16.4.2.1 If the innings of the side batting second is suspended (with at least 20 overs bowled(25 overs for the Semi-Finals and the Final)) and it is not possible for the match to be resumed, the match will be decided by comparison with the DLS ‘Par Score’ determined at the instant of the suspension using DLS. If the score is equal to the par score, the match is a Tie. Otherwise the result is a victory, or defeat, by the margin of runs by which the score exceeds, or falls short of, the Par Score. 16.5 Winning hit or extras 16.5.1 As soon as a result is reached as defined in clauses 16.1, 16.2 or 16.3.1, the match is at an end. Nothing that happens thereafter, except as in clause 41.17 (Penalty runs), shall be regarded as part of it. Note also clause 16.8. 16.5.2 The side batting last will have scored enough runs to win only if its total of runs is sufficient without including any runs completed by the batters before the completion of a catch, or the obstruction of a catch, from which the striker could be dismissed. 16.5.3 If a boundary is scored before the batters have completed sufficient runs to win the match, the whole of the boundary allowance shall be credited to the side’s total and, in the case of a hit by the bat, to the striker’s score. 16.6 Statement of result If the side batting last wins the match without losing all its wickets, the result shall be stated as a win by the number of wickets still then to fall, unless clause 16.4.2.1 (Prematurely Terminated Matches – Calculation of the Target Score) applies. If, without having scored a total of runs in excess of the total scored by the opposing side, the innings of the side batting last has been completed, but as the result of an award of 5 Penalty runs its total of runs is then sufficient to win, the result shall be stated as a win to that side by Penalty runs. If the side fielding last wins the match, the result shall be stated as a win by runs. If the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as Match Conceded or Match Awarded, as the case may be. 16.7 Correctness of result Any decision as to the correctness of the scores shall be the responsibility of the umpires. See clause 2.15 (Correctness of scores). 16.8 Mistakes in scoring If, after the players and umpires have left the field in the belief that the match has been concluded, the umpires discover that a mistake in scoring has occurred which affects the result then, subject to clause 16.9, they shall adopt the following procedure. 16.8.1 If, when the players leave the field, the side batting last has not completed its innings and either the number of overs to be bowled in that innings has not been completed, or the end of the innings has not been reached, then, unless one side concedes defeat, the umpires shall order play to resume. Unless a result is reached sooner, play will then continue, if conditions permit, until the prescribed number of overs has been completed. The number of overs shall be taken as they were at the call of Time for the 22 supposed conclusion of the match. No account shall be taken of the time between that moment and the resumption of play. 16.8.2 If, at this call of Time, the overs have been completed and no Playing time remains, or if the side batting last has completed its innings, the umpires shall immediately inform both captains of the necessary corrections to the scores and to the result. 16.9 Result not to be changed Once the umpires have agreed with the scorers the correctness of the scores at the conclusion of the match – see clauses 2.15 (Correctness of scores) and 3.2 (Correctness of scores) – the result cannot thereafter be changed. 16.9.1 clauses 2.15 (Correctness of scores) and 3.2 (Correctness of scores) – the result cannot thereafter be changed. Competition Format 16.10.1 The ICC U19 Cricket World Cup 2024 will be contested by 16 teams which have been divided into four groups: A - India (1) Bangladesh (8) Ireland (9) USA (16) B – England (2), South Africa (7), West Indies (10), Scotland (15) C – Australia (3), Sri Lanka (6), Zimbabwe (11), Namibia (14) D – Afghanistan (4), Pakistan (5), New Zealand (12), Nepal (13) The first round of the competition will be the Group stage. Each team will play every other team in its group. Points will be allocated for each match in accordance with the system described in clause 16.11.1 of these playing conditions. At the conclusion of the Group stage, the teams that finished 4th in each group will play in the following matches: A4 v D4 B4 v C4 Following the Group stage, the top 3 teams in each group will progress to the Super Six stage, comprising of two groups of 6 teams as follows: Super 6 AD Super 6 BC A1 D1 B1 C1 A2 D2 B2 C2 A3 D3 B3 C3 Each team that qualifies for the Super Six stage will carry forward the points that it gained in the matches that it played in the Group stage against the other two teams to have qualified for the Super Six Stage. The results of the Group stage matches (points, number of wins, net run rate) gained against the other teams from its Group that qualify will be carried forward to the Super Six stage. No other points, wins or net run rate from the Group stage will be carried forward to the Super Six stage. 16.10.2 Each team will play two more matches at the Super Six stage. These matches will be against the teams whose ranking at the Group stage was different from their own (e.g. Group winners do not play each other). The final Super Six tables will therefore be based on a total of four matches played by each team. Points will be allocated for each match in accordance with the system described in clause 16.11.1 of these playing conditions. 23 16.10.3 At the end of the Super Six stage, the top 2 teams in each Super Six group will progress to the semi-finals as follows: Semi-Final 1 – AD1 v BC2 Semi-Final 2 – BC1 v AD2 16.10.4 The winners of the Semi-Finals will contest the U19 Cricket World Cup Final 2024. 16.11 Progression of teams 16.11.1 Points The following point system will apply: Win 2 Tie, no result or abandoned 1 Loss 0 16.11.2 Tie breaker - Group Stage In the event of teams finishing on equal points in its Group, the right to progress to the Super Six Stage of the competition will be decided in the following order of priority: • The team with the greatest number of wins in the Group matches will be placed in the higher position. • If there are teams with equal points and equal wins in the Group matches then in such case the team with the higher net run rate in the Group matches will be placed in the higher position (refer to 16.11.6 below for the calculation of net run rate). • If two or more teams are still equal, they will be ordered according to the head-to-head match played between them (points then net run rate in those matches). • If the above does not resolve the Group ordering, or if all matches within a Group produce no results, then any tied teams will be ordered as per their Group seedings. 16.11.3 Tie breaker - Super Six Stage In the event of teams finishing on equal points in their Super Six Group, the right to progress to the semifinals will be decided in the following order of priority: a) The team with the greatest number of wins in its Super Six Group will be placed in the higher position. b) If there are teams with equal points and equal wins in its Super Six Group, then in such case the team with the higher net run rate in its Super Six Group will be placed in the higher position (refer to clause 16.11.6 below for the calculation of net run rate). c) If the above does not resolve the Super 6 Group ordering, or if all matches within a Super 6 Group produce no results, then the teams will be ordered as per their original Group seedings. 16.11.4 Semi Final • If a Semi-Final is tied, the teams shall compete in a Super Over to determine which team progresses to the Final. Refer attached Appendix G. • If following a tie, weather conditions prevent the Super Over from being completed, or if the match is abandoned or a no result, then the team that finished first in its Super Six Group will progress to the final. 16.11.5 Final • In the event of a tied final, the teams shall compete in a Super Over to determine which team is the winner. Refer attached Appendix G. 24 • If following a tie, weather conditions prevent the Super Over from being completed, or if the match is abandoned or a no result, the teams shall be declared joint winners. 16.11.6 Net Run Rate A team’s net run rate is calculated by deducting from the average runs per over scored by that team throughout the competition, the average runs per over scored against that team throughout the competition. In the event of a team being all out in less than its full quota of overs, the calculation of its net run rate shall be based on the full quota of overs to which it would have been entitled and not on the number of overs in which the team was dismissed. Only those matches where results are achieved will count for the purpose of net run rate calculations. Where a match is abandoned, but a result is achieved under Duckworth/Lewis/Stern, for net run rate purposes Team 1 will be credited with Team 2’s Par Score on abandonment off the same number of overs faced by Team 2.Where a match is concluded with Duckworth/Lewis/Stern having been applied at an earlier point in the match, Team 1 will be credited with 1 run less than the final Target Score for Team 2 off the total number of overs allocated to Team 2 to reach the target. In circumstances where a Group match (and the points for such match) is awarded to a team as a result of the other team’s refusal to play, either by the match referee in accordance with playing condition 16.2 or in accordance with the provisions of the relevant event agreements signed by the participating teams, the net run rate of the participating teams shall be affected as follows. If the refusal to play occurs after the minimum number of overs required to achieve a result has been bowled, the net run rate of the team awarded the win shall be updated as if play had been legitimately suspended when the refusal to play occurred. However the net run rate of the defaulting team shall be adjusted by increasing their total overs received by 50, with no adjustment made to their run scored or conceded, nor to their total overs bowled. If the refusal to play occurs during the match but prior to the minimum number of overs being bowled to achieve a result, or if the match is not started, the net run rate of the team awarded the win will remain unchanged (as per a no result). However, the net run rate of the defaulting team shall be adjusted by increasing their total overs received by 50, with no adjustment made to their run scored or conceded, nor to their total overs bowled. 17 THE OVER 17.1 Number of balls The ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 valid balls. 17.2 Start of an over An over has started when the bowler starts his run-up or, if there is no run-up, starts his action for the first delivery of that over. 17.3 Validity of balls 17.3.1 A ball shall not count as one of the 6 balls of the over unless it is delivered, even though, as in clause 38.3 (Non-striker leaving his ground early) a batter may be dismissed or some other incident occurs without the ball having been delivered. 17.3.2 A ball delivered by the bowler shall not count as one of the 6 balls of the over 17.3.2.1 if it is called dead, or is to be considered dead, before the striker has had an opportunity to play it. See clause 20.7 (Dead ball; ball counting as one of over). 17.3.2.2 if it is called dead in the circumstances of clause 20.4.2.6. Note also the special provisions of clause 20.4.2.5 (Umpire calling and signaling Dead ball) 17.3.2.3 if it is a No ball. See clause 21 (No ball). 25 17.3.2.4 if it is a Wide. See clause 22 (Wide ball). 17.3.2.5 when any of clauses 24.4 (Player returning without permission), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to distract striker), or 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter) is applied. 17.3.3 Any deliveries other than those listed in clauses 17.3.1 and 17.3.2 shall be known as valid balls. Only valid balls shall count towards the 6 balls of the over. 17.4 Call of Over When 6 valid balls have been bowled and when the ball becomes dead, the umpire shall call Over before leaving the wicket. See also clause 20.3 (Call of Over or Time). 17.5 Umpire miscounting 17.5.1 If the umpire miscounts the number of valid balls, the over as counted by the umpire shall stand. 17.5.2 If, having miscounted, the umpire allows an over to continue after 6 valid balls have been bowled, he/she may subsequently call Over when the ball becomes dead after any delivery, even if that delivery is not a valid ball. 17.5.3 Whenever possible, the third umpire shall liaise with the scorers and if possible inform the on-field umpires if the over has been miscounted. 17.6 Bowler changing ends A bowler shall be allowed to change ends as often as desired, provided he does not bowl two overs consecutively, nor bowl parts of each of two consecutive overs, in the same innings. 17.7 Finishing an over 17.7.1 Other than at the end of an innings, a bowler shall finish an over in progress unless incapacitated or suspended under these Playing Conditions. 17.7.2 If for any reason, other than the end of an innings, an over is left uncompleted at the start of an interval or interruption, it shall be completed on resumption of play. 17.8 Bowler incapacitated or suspended during an over If for any reason a bowler is incapacitated while running up to deliver the first ball of an over, or is incapacitated or suspended during an over, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball. If a bowler is incapacitated or suspended during an over, another bowler shall complete the over from the same end, provided that he does not bowl two overs consecutively, nor bowl parts of each of two consecutive overs, in that innings. 18 SCORING RUNS 18.1 A run The score shall be reckoned by runs. A run is scored 18.1.1 so often as the batters, at any time while the ball is in play, have crossed and made good their ground from end to end. 18.1.2 when a boundary is scored. See clause 19 (Boundaries). 18.1.3 when Penalty runs are awarded. See clause 18.6. 18.2 Runs disallowed and runs not scored Wherever in these Playing Conditions provision is made for the scoring of runs or awarding of penalties, such runs and penalties will be subject to any provisions that may be applicable for a run to be disallowed or a run not to be scored (see Appendix A 11) or for the non-award of penalties. 26 When runs are disallowed, the one run penalty for No ball or Wide shall stand and 5 run penalties shall be allowed, except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side). 18.3 Short runs 18.3.1 A run is short if a batter fails to make good his ground in turning for a further run. 18.3.2 Although a short run shortens the succeeding one, the latter if completed shall not be regarded as short. A striker setting off for the first run from in front of the popping crease may do so also without penalty. 18.4 Unintentional short runs Except in the circumstances of clause 18.5, 18.4.1 if either batter runs a short run, the umpire concerned shall, unless a boundary is scored, call and signal Short run as soon as the ball becomes dead and that run shall not be scored. In accordance with paragraph 2.5 of Appendix D, the third umpire shall review any call of Short run and communicate his/her decision to the relevant on-field umpire. 18.4.2 if, after either or both batters run short, a boundary is scored the umpire concerned shall disregard the short running and shall not call or signal Short run, unless the boundary is a result of an overthrow or wilful act of a fielder (see clause 19.8 – Overthrow or wilful act of fielder). 18.4.3 if both batters run short in one and the same run, this shall be regarded as only one short run. 18.4.4 if more than one run is short then, subject to clauses 18.4.2 and 18.4.3, all runs called as short shall not be scored. 18.4.5 if there has been more than one short run, the umpire shall inform the scorers as to the number of runs to be recorded. 18.5 Deliberate short runs 18.5.1 If either umpire considers that one or both batters deliberately ran short at that umpire’s end, the umpire concerned shall, when the ball is dead, call and signal Short run and inform the other umpire of what has occurred and apply clause 18.5.2. 18.5.2 The bowler’s end umpire shall - disallow all runs to the batting side - return any not out batter to his original end - signal No ball or Wide to the scorers, if applicable - repeat the Short run signal to the scorers - award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side - award any other 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side) - inform the scorers as to the number of runs to be recorded, and - inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the reason for this action. 18.6 Runs awarded for penalties Runs shall be awarded for penalties under clauses 18.5 (Deliberate short runs), 21 (No ball), 22 (Wide ball), 24.4 (Player returning without permission), 26.4 (Penalties for contravention), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side) 41 (Unfair play) and 42 (Players’ conduct). Note, however, the restrictions on the award of Penalty runs in clauses 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded), 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side) and 34 (Hit the ball twice). 27 18.7 Runs scored for boundaries Runs shall be scored for boundary allowances under clause 19 (Boundaries). 18.8 Runs scored when a batter is dismissed When a batter is dismissed, any runs for penalties awarded to either side shall stand. No other runs shall be credited to the batting side, except as follows. 18.8.1 If a batter is dismissed Obstructing the field, the batting side shall also score any runs completed before the offence. If, however, the obstruction or distraction prevented a catch being made, no runs other than penalties shall be scored. 18.8.2 If a batter is dismissed Run out, the batting side shall also score any runs completed before the wicket was fairly broken. 18.9 Runs scored when the ball becomes dead other than at the fall of a wicket When the ball becomes dead for any reason other than the fall of a wicket, or is called dead by an umpire, unless there is specific provision otherwise in these Playing Conditions, any runs for penalties awarded to either side shall be scored. Note however the provisions of clauses 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded) and 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side). Additionally the batting side shall be credited with all runs completed by the batters before the incident or call of Dead ball and the run in progress if the batters had already crossed at the instant of the incident or call of Dead ball. Note specifically, however, the provisions of clause 41.5.8 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter). 18.10Crediting of runs scored Unless stated otherwise in these Playing Conditions, 18.10.1 if the ball is struck by the bat, all runs scored by the batting side shall be credited to the striker, except for the following: - an award of 5 Penalty runs, which shall be scored as Penalty runs - the one run penalty for a No ball, which shall be scored as a No ball extra. 18.10.2 if the ball is not struck by the bat, runs shall be scored as Penalty runs, Byes, Leg byes, No ball extras or Wides as the case may be. If Byes or Leg byes accrue from a No ball, only the one run penalty for No ball shall be scored as such, and the remainder as Byes or Leg byes as appropriate. 18.10.3 the bowler shall be debited with: - all runs scored by the striker - all runs scored as No ball extras - all runs scored as Wides. 18.11Batter returning to original end 18.11.1 When the striker is dismissed in any of the circumstances in clauses 18.11.1.1 to 18.11.1.57, the not out batter shall return to his original end. 18.11.1.1 Bowled. 18.11.1.2 Stumped. 18.11.1.3 Hit the ball twice. 28 18.11.1.4 LBW. 18.11.1.5 Hit wicket. 18.11.1.6 Caught 18.11.1.7 Obstructing the field, where the obstruction or distraction prevents the striker being out caught. 18.11.2 The batters shall return to their original ends in any of the cases of clauses 18.11.2.1 to 18.11.2.3. 18.11.2.1 A boundary is scored unless as a result of an overthrow or wilful act of a fielder (see clause 19.8). 18.11.2.2 Runs are disallowed for any reason. 18.11.2.3 the batters at the wicket decide to do so, under clause 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter). 18.12Batter returning to wicket he has left 18.12.1 When a batter is dismissed in any of the ways in clauses 18.12.11 to 18.12.1.2, the not out batter shall return to the wicket he has left but only if the batters had not already crossed at the instant of the incident causing the dismissal. If runs are to be disallowed, however, the not out batter shall return to his original end. 18.12.1.1 Obstructing the field, where the obstruction or distraction does not prevent the striker being out Caught. 18.12.1.2 Run out. 18.12.2 If, while a run is in progress, the ball becomes dead for any reason other than the dismissal of a batter, the batters shall return to the wickets they had left, but only if they had not already crossed in running when the ball became dead. If, however, any of the circumstances of clauses 18.11.2.1 to 18.11.2.3 apply, the batters shall return to their original ends. 19 BOUNDARIES 19.1 Determining the boundary of the field of play 19.1.1 Before the toss, the umpires shall determine the boundary of the field of play, which shall be fixed for the duration of the match. See clause 2.3.22 (Consultation with Ground Authority). 19.1.2 The boundary shall be determined such that no part of any sight-screen, will, at any stage of the match, be within the field of play. 19.1.3 The aim shall be to maximize the size of the playing area at each venue. With respect to the size of the boundaries, no boundary shall be longer than 90 yards (82.29 meters), and no boundary should be shorter than 65 yards (59.43 metres) from the centre of the pitch to be used. 19.1.4 At all times, there must be 3 yards (2.74 meters) from the boundary rope to the first solid object (advertising boards/LEDs, photographers, cameramen, dug outs, covers, perimeter fence) for the player’s safety run off. 19.1.5 If the boundary is positioned less than 90 yards (82.29 meters) from the centre of the pitch, the boundary rope cannot be set at a distance of more than 10 yards (9.14 meters) from the perimeter fence. The 10 yards shall be inclusive of the 3 yards (2.74 meters) provided for the player’s safety run off. 19.1.6 Any ground which has previously been approved to host international cricket which is unable to conform to the minimum boundary dimension shall be exempt. In such cases the boundary shall be positioned so as to maximize the size of the playing area. 19.2 Identifying and marking the boundary 19.2.1 All boundaries must be designated by a rope, or similar object of a minimum standard as authorised by the ICC from time to time. 29 19.2.2 If the boundary is marked by means of an object that is in contact with the ground the boundary will be the edge of the grounded part of the object which is nearest the pitch. 19.2.3 An obstacle within the field of play shall not be regarded as a boundary unless so determined by the umpires before the toss. See clause 2.3.2 (Consultation with Ground Authority). 19.2.4 If an unauthorised person enters the playing arena and handles the ball, the umpire at the bowler’s end shall be the sole judge of whether the boundary allowance should be scored or the ball be treated as still in play or called dead ball if a batter is liable to be out as a result of the unauthorised person handling the ball. See also clause 20.4.2.12 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball). 19.3 Restoring the boundary If a solid object used to mark the boundary is disturbed for any reason, then: 19.3.1 the boundary shall be considered to be in its original position. 19.3.2 the object shall be returned to its original position as soon as is practicable; if play is taking place, this shall be as soon as the ball is dead. 19.3.3 if some part of a fence or other marker has come within the field of play, that part shall be removed from the field of play as soon as is practicable; if play is taking place, this shall be as soon as the ball is dead. 19.4 Ball grounded beyond the boundary 19.4.1 The ball in play is grounded beyond the boundary if it touches - the boundary or any part of an object used to mark the boundary; - the ground beyond the boundary; - any object that is grounded beyond the boundary. 19.4.2 The ball in play is to be regarded as being grounded beyond the boundary if - a fielder, grounded beyond the boundary as in clause 19.5, touches the ball; - a fielder, after catching the ball within the boundary, becomes grounded beyond the boundary while in contact with the ball, before completing the catch. 19.5 Fielder grounded beyond the boundary 19.5.1 A fielder is grounded beyond the boundary if some part of his person is in contact with any of the following: - the boundary or any part of an object used to mark the boundary; - the ground beyond the boundary; - any object that is in contact with the ground beyond the boundary; - another fielder who is grounded beyond the boundary. 19.5.2 A fielder who is not in contact with the ground is considered to be grounded beyond the boundary if his final contact with the ground, before his first contact with the ball after it has been delivered by the bowler, was not entirely within the boundary. 19.6 Boundary allowances 19.6.1 6 runs shall be allowed for a boundary 6; and 4 runs for a boundary 4. See also clause 19.7. 19.7 Runs scored from boundaries 19.7.1 A boundary 6 will be scored if and only if the ball has been struck by the bat and is first grounded beyond the boundary without having been in contact with the ground within the field of play. This shall apply even if the ball has previously touched a fielder. 30 19.7.2 A boundary 4 will be scored when a ball that is grounded beyond the boundary - whether struck by the bat or not, was first grounded within the boundary, or - has not been struck by the bat. 19.7.3 When a boundary is scored, the batting side, except in the circumstances of clause 19.8, shall be awarded whichever is the greater of 19.7.3.1 the allowance for the boundary 19.7.3.2 the runs completed by the batters together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant the boundary is scored. 19.7.4 When the runs in clause 19.7.3.2 exceed the boundary allowance they shall replace the boundary allowance for the purposes of clause 18.12.2. 19.7.5 The scoring of Penalty runs by either side is not affected by the scoring of a boundary. 19.8 Overthrow or wilful act of fielder If the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be any runs for penalties awarded to either side and the allowance for the boundary and the runs completed by the batters, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the throw or act. Clause 18.12.2 (Batter returning to wicket he has left) shall apply as from the instant of the throw or act. 20 DEAD BALL 20.1 Ball is dead 20.1.1 The ball becomes dead when 20.1.1.1 it is finally settled in the hands of the wicket-keeper or of the bowler. 20.1.1.2 a boundary is scored. See clause 19.7 (Runs scored from boundaries). 20.1.1.3 a batter is dismissed. The ball will be deemed to be dead from the instant of the incident causing the dismissal. 20.1.1.4 whether played or not it becomes trapped between the bat and person of a batter or between items of his clothing or equipment. 20.1.1.5 whether played or not it lodges in the clothing or equipment of a batter or the clothing of an umpire. 20.1.1.6 there is an award of Penalty runs under either of clauses 24.4 (Player returning without permission) or 28.3 (Fielding the ball). The ball shall not count as one of the over. 20.1.1.7 there is a contravention of clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side). 20.1.1.8 the match is concluded in any of the ways stated in clause 12.6 (Conclusion of match). 20.1.2 The ball shall be considered to be dead when it is clear to the bowler’s end umpire that the fielding side and both batters at the wicket have ceased to regard it as in play. 20.1.3 In a match where cameras are being used on or over the field of play (e.g. Spidercam), should a ball that has been hit by the batter make contact, while still in play, with the camera, its apparatus or its cable, either umpire shall call and signal ‘dead ball’. The ball shall not count as one of the over and no runs shall be scored. If the delivery was called a No ball it shall count and the No ball penalty shall be applied. No other runs (including penalty runs) apart from the No ball penalty shall be scored. 31 20.1.4 Should a ball thrown by a fielder make contact with a camera on or over the field of play, its apparatus or its cable, either umpire shall call and signal dead ball. Unless this was already a No ball or Wide, the ball shall count as one of the over. All runs scored to that point shall count, plus the run in progress if the batters have already crossed. 20.1.5 Refer also to paragraph 2.7 of Appendix D. 20.2 Ball finally settled Whether the ball is finally settled or not is a matter for the umpire alone to decide. 20.3 Call of Over or Time Neither the call of Over (see clause 17.4), nor the call of Time (see clause 12.2) is to be made until the ball is dead, either under clauses 20.1 or 20.4. 20.4 Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball 20.4.1 When the ball has become dead under clause 20.1, the bowler’s end umpire may call and signal Dead ball if it is necessary to inform the players. 20.4.2 Where either umpire is required to call and signal Dead ball under 20.4.2.1 to 20.4.2.14, the ball will be considered to be dead at the instant of the incident causing the ball to become dead. However, where the Playing Conditions specifically provide for the call to be delayed, so as not to disadvantage the nonoffending side, under clause 34.4 (Runs permitted from the ball lawfully struck more than once), clause 41.2.1 (Unfair actions) and clause 42.1.2 (Unacceptable conduct), the ball will be considered to be dead at the point of the call. Either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball when 20.4.2.1 intervening in a case of unfair play. 20.4.2.2 a possibly serious injury to a player or umpire occurs. 20.4.2.3 leaving his/her normal position for consultation. 20.4.2.4 one or both bails fall from the striker’s wicket before the striker has had the opportunity of playing the ball. 20.4.2.5 the striker is not ready for the delivery of the ball and, if the ball is delivered, makes no attempt to play it. Provided the umpire is satisfied that the striker had adequate reason for not being ready, the ball shall not count as one of the over. 20.4.2.6 the striker is distracted by any noise or movement or in any other way while preparing to receive, or receiving a delivery. This shall apply whether the source of the distraction is within the match or outside it. Note also clause 20.4.2.7. The ball shall not count as one of the over. 20.4.2.7 there is an instance of a deliberate attempt to distract under either of clauses 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to distract striker) or 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter). The ball shall not count as one of the over. 20.4.2.8 the bowler drops the ball accidentally before delivery. 20.4.2.9 the bowler throws the ball towards the striker’s end before entering his/her delivery stride 20.4.2.10 the ball does not leave the bowler’s hand for any reason other than an attempt to run out the nonstriker under clause 38.3 (Non-striker leaving his ground early). 20.4.2.11 satisfied that the ball in play cannot be recovered. 20.4.2.12 he/she considers that either side has been disadvantaged by a person, animal or other object within the field of play. However, if both umpires consider the ball would have reached the boundary regardless of the intervention, the boundary should stand (see clause 19.2.4 – Identifying and marking the boundary). 32 20.4.2.13 the striker attempts to play the ball and no part of his/her person, whether grounded or raised, remains within the pitch as defined in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch). 20.4.2.14 required to do so under any of the Playing Conditions not included above. 20.5 Ball ceases to be dead The ball ceases to be dead – that is, it comes into play – when the bowler starts his run-up or, if there is no run-up, starts his bowling action. 20.6 Dead ball not to be revoked Once the ball is dead, no revoking of any decision can bring the ball back into play for that delivery. 20.7 Dead ball; ball counting as one of over 20.7.1 When a ball which has been delivered is called dead or is to be considered dead then, other than as in clause 20.7.2, 20.7.1.1 it will not count in the over if the striker has not had an opportunity to play it. 20.7.1.2 Unless No ball or Wide ball has been called, it will be a valid ball if the striker has had an opportunity to play it, except in the circumstances of clauses 20.4.2.6 and 24.4 ( Player returning without permission), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to distract striker) and 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter). 20.7.2 In clause 20.4.2.5, the ball will not count in the over only if both conditions of not attempting to play the ball and having an adequate reason for not being ready are met. Otherwise the delivery will be a valid ball. 21 NO BALL 21.1 Mode of delivery 21.1.1 The umpire shall ascertain whether the bowler intends to bowl right handed or left handed, over or round the wicket, and shall so inform the striker. It is unfair if the bowler fails to notify the umpire of a change in his mode of delivery. In this case the umpire shall call and signal No ball. 21.1.2 Underarm bowling shall not be permitted. 21.2 Fair delivery – the arm For a delivery to be fair in respect of the arm the ball must not be delivered with an Illegal Bowling Action. An Illegal Bowling Action is defined as a bowling action where a bowler’s Elbow Extension exceeds 15 degrees, measured from the point at which the bowling arm reaches the horizontal until the point at which the ball is released (any Elbow Hyperextension shall be discounted for the purposes of determining an Illegal Bowling Action). Should either umpire or the ICC Match Referee suspect that a bowler has used an Illegal Bowling Action, they shall complete the ICC Bowling Action Report Form at the conclusion of the match, as set out in the Illegal Bowling Regulations. 21.3 Ball thrown or delivered underarm – action by umpires 21.3.1 If, in the opinion of either umpire, the ball has been thrown (where such mode of delivery does not correspond to the bowler’s normal bowling action) or delivered underarm, he/she shall call and signal No ball and, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. The bowler’s end umpire shall then - warn the bowler, indicating that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall apply to that bowler throughout the innings. 33 - inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. - inform the batters at the wicket of what has occurred. 21.3.2 If either umpire considers that, in that innings, a further delivery by the same bowler is thrown (where such mode of delivery does not correspond to the bowler’s normal bowling action) or delivered underarm, he/she shall call and signal No ball and when the ball is dead inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. The bowler’s end umpire shall then - direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling. The over shall, if applicable, be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled the previous over or part thereof nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. The bowler thus suspended shall not bowl again in that innings. - inform the batters at the wicket and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the reason for this action. 21.3.3 The umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the ICC Match Referee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. 21.4 Bowler throwing towards striker’s end before delivery If the bowler throws the ball towards the striker’s end before entering the delivery stride, it is not a No ball and the procedure stated in 21.3 shall not apply. However, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball under Clause 20.4.2.9. 21.5 Fair delivery – the feet For a delivery to be fair in respect of the feet, in the delivery stride 21.5.1 the bowler’s back foot must land within and not touching the return crease appertaining to his stated mode of delivery. 21.5.2 the bowler’s front foot must land with some part of the foot, whether grounded or raised - on the same side of the imaginary line joining the two middle stumps as the return crease described in clause 21.5.1, and - behind the popping crease. The third umpire shall, upon request following a dismissal, review television replays of the bowler’s feet landing and, if he/she is satisfied that not all the requirements have been met, advise the bowler’s end umpire who shall in turn immediately call and signal No ball. See clause 41.8 (Bowling of deliberate front foot No ball). In addition, if the third umpire, having reviewed television replays of the front foot landing, judges that the bowler’s front foot did not land with some part of the foot, whether grounded or raised, behind the popping crease, he/she shall immediately advise the bowler’s end umpire who shall in turn immediately call and signal No ball. 21.6 Bowler breaking wicket in delivering ball Either umpire shall call and signal No ball if, other than in an attempt to run out the non-striker under clause 38.3 (Non-striker leaving his/her ground early), the bowler breaks the wicket at any time after the ball comes into play and before completion of the stride after the delivery stride. This shall include any clothing or other object that falls from his person and breaks the wicket. 21.7 Ball bouncing more than once, rolling along the ground or pitching off the pitch The umpire shall call and signal No ball if a ball which he/she considers to have been delivered, without having previously touched bat or person of the striker, - bounces more than once 34 - or rolls along the ground before it reaches the popping crease. - or pitches wholly or partially off the pitch as defined in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch) before it reaches the line of the striker’s wicket. 21.8 Ball causing the striker to leave the pitch or ball coming to rest in front of striker’s wicket If a ball delivered by the bowler comes to rest in front of the line of the striker’s wicket, or is so far from the pitch that the striker would need to leave the pitch to attempt to play the ball (see clause 25.6 – Striker’s right to play the ball) without having previously touched the bat or person of the striker, the umpire shall call and signal No ball and immediately call and signal Dead ball. 21.9 Fielder intercepting a delivery If except in the circumstances of clause 27.3 (Position of wicket-keeper) a ball, delivered by the bowler, makes contact with any part of a fielder’s person before it either makes contact with the striker’s bat or person, or it passes the striker’s wicket, the umpire shall call and signal No ball and immediately call and signal Dead ball. 21.10Ball bouncing over head height of striker See clauses 22.1.1.2 and 41.6.1.7. 21.11Call of No ball for infringement of other clauses In addition to the instances above, No ball is to be called and signalled as required by the following: Clause 27.3 – Position of wicket-keeper Clause 28.4 – Limitation of on side fielders Clause 28.5 – Fielders not to encroach on pitch Clause 41.6 – Bowling of dangerous and unfair short pitched deliveries Clause 41.7 – Bowling of dangerous and unfair non-pitching deliveries Clause 41.8 – Bowling of deliberate front foot No ball. 21.12Revoking a call of No ball An umpire shall revoke the call of No ball if Dead ball is called under any of Laws 20.4.2.4, 20.4.2.5, 20.4.2.6, 20.4.2.8 or 20.4.2.10 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball). 21.13No ball to over-ride Wide A call of No ball shall over-ride the call of Wide ball at any time. See clauses 22.1 (Judging a Wide) and 22.2 (Call and signal of Wide ball). 21.14Ball not dead The ball does not become dead on the call of No ball. 21.15Penalty for a No ball A penalty of one run shall be awarded instantly on the call of No ball. Unless the call is revoked, the penalty shall stand even if a batter is dismissed. It shall be in addition to any other runs scored, any boundary allowance and any other runs awarded for penalties. 21.16Runs resulting from a No ball – how scored The one run penalty shall be scored as a No ball extra and shall be debited against the bowler. If other Penalty runs have been awarded to either side these shall be scored as stated in clause 41.17 (Penalty runs). Any runs completed 35 by the batters or any boundary allowance shall be credited to the striker if the ball has been struck by the bat; otherwise they shall also be scored as Byes or Leg byes as appropriate. 21.17No ball not to count A No ball shall not count as one of the over. See clause 17.3 (Validity of balls). 21.18Out from a No ball When No ball has been called, neither batter shall be out under any of the Playing Conditions except clause 34 (Hit the ball twice), clause 37 (Obstructing the field) or clause 38 (Run out). 21.19Free Hit 21.19.1 In addition to the above, the delivery following a No ball called (all modes of No ball) shall be a free hit for whichever batter is facing it. If the delivery for the free hit is not a legitimate delivery (any kind of No ball or a Wide ball) then the next delivery will become a free hit for whichever batter is facing it. 21.19.2 For any free hit, the striker can be dismissed only under the circumstances that apply for a No ball, even if the delivery for the free hit is called Wide. 21.19.3 Neither field changes nor the exchange of individuals between fielding positions are permitted for free hit deliveries unless: 21.19.3.1 There is a change of striker (the provisions of clause 41.2 shall apply), or 21.19.3.2 The No Ball was the result of a fielding restriction breach, in which case the field may be changed to the extent of correcting the breach. 21.19.4 For clarity, the bowler can change his mode of delivery for the free hit delivery. In such circumstances clause 21.1 shall apply. 21.19.5 The umpires will signal a free hit by (after the normal No Ball signal) extending one arm straight upwards and moving it in a circular motion. 22 WIDE BALL 22.1 Judging a Wide 22.1.1 If the bowler bowls a ball, not being a No ball, the umpire shall adjudge it a Wide if, according to the definition in clause 22.1.2 22.1.1.1 the ball passes wide of where the striker is standing and which also would have passed wide of the striker standing in a normal batting position. 22.1.1.2 the ball passes above the head height of the striker standing upright at the popping crease. 22.1.2 The ball will be considered as passing wide of the striker unless it is sufficiently within reach for him to be able to hit it with the bat by means of a normal cricket stroke. 22.1.3 Umpires are instructed to apply very strict and consistent interpretation in regard to this clause in order to prevent negative bowling wide of the wicket. 22.2 Call and signal of Wide ball If the umpire adjudges a delivery to be a Wide he/she shall call and signal Wide ball as soon as the ball passes the striker’s wicket. It shall, however, be considered to have been a Wide from the instant that the bowler entered his delivery stride, even though it cannot be called Wide until it passes the striker’s wicket. 22.3 Revoking a call of Wide ball 22.3.1 The umpire shall revoke the call of Wide ball if there is any contact between the ball and the striker’s bat or person before the ball comes into contact with any fielder. 36 22.3.2 The umpire shall revoke the call of Wide ball if a delivery is called a No ball. See clause 21.13 (No ball to over-ride Wide). 22.4 Delivery not a Wide 22.4.1 The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide, if the striker, by moving, either causes the ball to pass wide of him, as defined in clause 22.1.2 or brings the ball sufficiently within reach to be able to hit it by means of a normal cricket stroke. 22.4.2 The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide if the ball touches the striker’s bat or person, but only as the ball passes the striker. 22.5 Ball not dead The ball does not become dead on the call of Wide ball. 22.6 Penalty for a Wide A penalty of one run shall be awarded instantly on the call of Wide ball. Unless the call is revoked, under clause 22.3, this penalty shall stand even if a batter is dismissed, and shall be in addition to any other runs scored, any boundary allowance and any other runs awarded for penalties. 22.7 Runs resulting from a Wide – how scored All runs completed by the batters or a boundary allowance, together with the penalty for the Wide, shall be scored as Wide balls. Apart from any award of 5 Penalty runs, all runs resulting from a Wide shall be debited against the bowler. 22.8 Wide not to count A Wide shall not count as one of the over. See clause 17.3 (Validity of balls). 22.9 Out from a Wide When Wide ball has been called, neither batter shall be out under any of the Playing Conditions except clause 35 (Hit wicket), clause 37 (Obstructing the field), clause 38 (Run out) or clause 39 (Stumped). 23 BYE AND LEG BYE 23.1 Byes If the ball, delivered by the bowler, not being a Wide, passes the striker without touching his bat or person, any runs completed by the batters from that delivery, or a boundary allowance, shall be credited as Byes to the batting side. Additionally, if the delivery is a No ball, the one run penalty for such a delivery shall be incurred. 23.2 Leg byes 23.2.1 If a ball delivered by the bowler first strikes the person of the striker, runs shall be scored only if the umpire is satisfied that the striker has either attempted to play the ball with the bat or tried to avoid being hit by the ball. 23.2.2 If the umpire is satisfied that either of these conditions has been met runs shall be scored as follows. 23.2.2.1 If there is either no subsequent contact with the striker’s bat or person, or only inadvertent contact with the striker’s bat or person any runs completed by the batters or a boundary allowance shall be credited to the striker in the case of subsequent contact with his bat but otherwise to the batting side as in clause 23.2.3. 37 23.2.2.2 If the striker wilfully makes a lawful second strike, clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once) and clause 34.4 (Runs permitted from ball lawfully struck more than once) shall apply. 23.2.3 The runs in clause 23.2.2.1, unless credited to the striker, shall be scored as Leg byes. Additionally, if the delivery is a No ball, the one run penalty for the No ball shall be incurred. 23.3 Leg byes not to be awarded If in the circumstance of clause 23.2.1 the umpire considers that neither of the conditions therein has been met, then Leg byes shall not be awarded. If the ball does not become dead for any other reason, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball as soon as the ball reaches the boundary or at the completion of the first run. The umpire shall then: - disallow all runs to the batting side; - return any not out batter to his original end; - signal No ball to the scorers if applicable; - award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side). 24 FIELDER’S ABSENCE; SUBSTITUTES 24.1 Substitute fielders 24.1.1 The umpires shall allow a substitute fielder 24.1.1.1 if they are satisfied that a fielder has been injured or become ill and that this occurred during the match, or 24.1.1.2 for any other wholly acceptable reason. In all other circumstances, a substitute is not allowed. 24.1.2 A substitute shall not bowl or act as captain but may act as wicket-keeper only with the consent of the umpires. Note, however, clause 42.4.1. 24.1.3 A nominated player may bowl or field even though a substitute has previously acted for him, subject to 24.2 and 24.3. 24.1.4 Squad members of the fielding or batting team who are not playing in the match and who are not acting as substitute fielders shall be required to wear a team training bib whilst on the playing area (including the area between the boundary and the perimeter fencing). 24.2 Fielder absent or leaving the field of play 24.2.1 A player going briefly outside the boundary while carrying out any duties as a fielder is not absent from the field of play nor, for the purposes of this clause, is he to be regarded as having left the field of play. 24.2.2 If a fielder fails to take the field at the start of play or at any later time, or leaves the field during play, 24.2.2.1 an umpire shall be informed of the reason for this absence. 24.2.2.2 he shall not thereafter come on to the field of play during a session of play without the consent of the umpire. See clause 24.4. The umpire shall give such consent as soon as it is practicable. 24.2.3 If a player is absent from the field for longer than 8 minutes, the following restrictions shall apply to their future participation in the match: 38 24.2.3.1 The player shall not be permitted to bowl in the match until he has either been able to field, or his team has subsequently been batting, for the total length of playing time for which the player was absent (hereafter referred to as Penalty time). A player’s unexpired Penalty time shall be limited to a maximum of 120 minutes. If any unexpired Penalty time remains at the end of an innings, it is carried forward to the next and subsequent innings of the match. 24.2.3.2 The player shall not be permitted to bat in the match until his team’s batting innings has been in progress for the length of playing time that is equal to the unexpired Penalty time carried forward from the previous innings. However, once his side has lost five wickets in its batting innings, he may bat immediately. If any unexpired penalty time remains at the end of that batting innings, it is carried forward to the next and subsequent innings of the match. 24.2.4 If the player leaves the field before having served all of his Penalty time, the balance is carried forward as unserved Penalty time. 24.2.5 On any occasion of absence, the amount of playing time for which the player is off the field shall be added to any Penalty time that remains unserved, subject to a maximum cumulative Penalty time of 120 minutes, and that player shall not bowl until all of his Penalty time has been served. 24.2.6 For the purposes of clauses 24.2.3.1 and 24.2.3.2, playing time shall comprise the time play is in progress excluding intervals, intervals between innings and official drinks intervals. For clarity, a player’s Penalty time will continue to expire after he is dismissed, for the remainder of his team’s batting innings. 24.2.7 If there is an unscheduled break in play, the stoppage time shall count as Penalty time served, provided that, 24.2.7.1 the fielder who was on the field of play at the start of the break either takes the field on the resumption of play, or his side is now batting. 24.2.7.2 the fielder who was already off the field at the start of the break notifies an umpire in person as soon as he is able to participate, and either takes the field on the resumption of play, or his side is now batting. Stoppage time before an umpire has been so notified shall not count towards unserved Penalty time. 24.2.8 Any unserved Penalty time shall be carried forward into the next innings of the match, as applicable. 24.3 Penalty time not incurred A nominated player’s absence will not incur Penalty time if, 24.3.1 he has suffered an external blow during the match and, as a result, has justifiably left the field or is unable to take the field. 24.3.2 in the opinion of the umpires, the player has been absent or has left the field for other wholly acceptable reasons, which shall not include illness or internal injury. 24.3.3 the player is absent from the field for a period of 8 minutes or less. 24.4 Player returning without permission If a player comes on to the field of play in contravention of clause 24.2.2 and comes into contact with the ball while it is in play, the ball shall immediately become dead. - The umpires shall signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers, if applicable. - The umpire shall award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. - Runs completed by the batters shall be scored together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the offence. - The ball shall not count as one of the over. - The umpire shall inform the other umpire, the captain of the fielding side, the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the reason for this action. 39 25 BATTER’S INNINGS 25.1 Eligibility to act as a batter Only a nominated player may bat and, subject to clause 25.3, may do so even though a substitute fielder has previously acted for him. 25.2 Commencement of a batter’s innings The innings of the first two batters, and that of any new batter on the resumption of play after a call of Time, shall commence at the call of Play. At any other time, a batter’s innings shall be considered to have commenced when that batter first steps onto the field of play. 25.3 Restriction on batter commencing an innings 25.3.1 If a member of the batting side has unserved Penalty time, see clause 24.2.7, that player shall not be permitted to bat until that Penalty time has been served. However, even if the unserved Penalty time has not expired, that player may bat after his side has lost 5 wickets. 25.3.2 A member of the batting side’s Penalty time is served during Playing time, in the event of an unscheduled stoppage, the stoppage time after the batter notifies an umpire in person that he is able to participate shall count as Penalty time served. 25.3.3 If any unserved Penalty time remains at the end of a team’s innings, it shall be carried forward to the next innings of the match if appropriate. 25.4 Batter retiring 25.4.1 A batter may retire at any time during his innings when the ball is dead. The umpires, before allowing play to proceed, shall be informed of the reason for a batter retiring. 25.4.2 If a batter retires because of illness, injury or any other unavoidable cause, that batter is entitled to resume his innings. If for any reason this does not happen, that batter is to be recorded as ‘Retired - not out’. 25.4.3 If a batter retires for any reason other than as in clause 25.4.2, the innings of that batter may be resumed only with the consent of the opposing captain. If for any reason his innings is not resumed, that batter is to be recorded as ‘Retired - out’. 25.4.4 If after retiring a batter resumes his innings, subject to the requirements of clauses 25.4.2 and 25.4.3, it shall be only at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of another batter. 25.5 Runners Runners shall not be permitted. 25.6 Striker’s right to play the ball The striker has a right to play the ball, or to make a legitimate second strike, after it has been delivered, without interference from the wicket-keeper or any other fielder (see clause 27.5 – Restrictions on actions of wicket-keeper and clause 27.6 – Interference with wicket-keeper by striker). However, the striker may only attempt to play the ball if some of his/her bat or person, whether grounded or raised, remains within the pitch, as defined in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch). Should no part of the striker’s bat or person remain within the pitch, whilst the striker is playing the ball, either umpire shall immediately call and signal Dead ball. 26 PRACTICE ON THE FIELD 26.1 Practice on the pitch or the rest of the square 26.1.1 There shall not be any practice on the pitch at any time. 40 26.1.2 There shall not be any practice on the rest of the square at any time except with the approval of the umpires. 26.1.2.1 If approved by the umpires, the use of the square for practice on any day of any match will be restricted to any netted practice area or bowling strips specifically prepared on the edge of the square for that purpose. 26.1.2.2 Bowling practice on the bowling strips referred to above shall also be permitted during the interval (and change of innings if not the interval) unless the umpires consider that, in the prevailing conditions of ground and weather, it will be detrimental to the surface of the square. 26.2 Practice on the outfield 26.2.1 On any day of the match, all forms of practice are permitted on the outfield - before the start of play - after the close of play, and - during the interval or between innings providing the umpires are satisfied that such practice will not cause significant deterioration in the condition of the outfield. 26.2.2 Between the call of Play and the call of Time, practice shall be permitted on the outfield, providing that all of the following conditions are met: - only the fielders as defined in paragraph 7 of Appendix A participate in such practice. - no ball other than the match ball is used for this practice. - no bowling practice takes place in the area between the square and the boundary in a direction parallel to the match pitch. - the umpires are satisfied that it will not contravene either of clauses 41.3 (The match ball changing its condition) or 41.9 (Time wasting by the fielding side). Bowling a ball, using a short run up to a player in the outfield is not to be regarded as bowling practice but shall be subject to the other conditions in this clause. 26.3 Trial run-up A bowler is permitted to have a trial run-up provided the umpire is satisfied that it will not contravene either of clauses 41.9 (Time wasting by the fielding side) or 41.12 (Fielder damaging the pitch). 26.4 Penalties for contravention All forms of practice are subject to the provisions of clauses 41.3 (The match ball – changing its condition), 41.9 (Time wasting by the fielding side) and 41.12 (Fielder damaging the pitch). 26.4.1 If there is a contravention of any of the provisions of clause 26.1 or 26.2, the umpire shall - warn the player that the practice is not permitted; - inform the other umpire and, as soon as practicable, both captains of the reason for this action. 26.4.1.1 If the contravention is by a batter at the wicket, the umpire shall inform the other batter and each incoming batter that the warning has been issued. The warning shall apply to the team of that player throughout the match. 26.4.2 If during the match there is any further contravention by any player of that team, the umpire shall - award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side; - inform the other umpire, the scorers and, as soon as practicable, both captains, and, if the contravention is during play, the batters at the wicket. 41 27 THE WICKET-KEEPER 27.1 Protective equipment The wicket-keeper is the only fielder permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards. If these are worn, they are to be regarded as part of his person for the purposes of clause 28.2 (Fielding the ball). If by the wicket-keeper’s actions and positioning when the ball comes into play it is apparent to the umpires that he will not be able to carry out the normal duties of a wicket-keeper, he shall forfeit this right and also the right to be recognised as a wicket-keeper for the purposes of clauses 33.2 (A fair catch), 39 (Stumped), 28.1 (Protective equipment), 28.4 (Limitation of on-side fielders) and 28.5 (Fielders not to encroach on pitch). 27.2 Gloves 27.2.1 If, as permitted under clause 27.1, the wicket-keeper wears gloves, they shall have no webbing between the fingers except joining index finger and thumb, where webbing may be inserted as a means of support. 27.2.2 If used, the webbing shall be a single piece of non-stretch material which, although it may have facing material attached, shall have no reinforcements or tucks. 27.2.3 The top edge of the webbing shall not protrude beyond the straight line joining the top of the index finger to the top of the thumb and shall be taut when a hand wearing the glove has the thumb fully extended. See paragraph 3 of Appendix B. 27.3 Position of wicket-keeper 27.3.1 The wicket-keeper shall remain wholly behind the wicket at the striker’s end from the moment the ball comes into play until a ball delivered by the bowler touches the bat or person of the striker, or passes the wicket at the striker’s end, or the striker attempts a run. 27.3.2 In the event of the wicket-keeper contravening this clause, the striker’s end umpire shall call and signal No ball as soon as applicable after the delivery of the ball. 27.4 Movement by wicket-keeper 27.4.1 After the ball comes into play and before it reaches the striker, it is unfair if the wicket-keeper significantly alters his position in relation to the striker’s wicket, except for the following: 27.4.1.1 movement of a few paces forward for a slower delivery, unless in so doing it brings him within reach of the wicket. 27.4.1.2 lateral movement in response to the direction in which the ball has been delivered. 27.4.1.3 movement in response to the stroke that the striker is playing or that his actions suggest he intends to play. However the provisions of clause 27.3 shall apply. 27.4.2 In the event of unfair movement by the wicket-keeper, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for doing so. The bowler’s end umpire shall then: 27.4.2.1 award the one-run penalty for Wide or No ball, if applicable 27.4.2.2 award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side 27.4.2.3 inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. 27.4.2.4 inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. The umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the ICC Match Referee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the wicketkeeper concerned. 42 27.5 Restriction on actions of wicket-keeper If, in the opinion of either umpire, the wicket-keeper interferes with the striker’s right to play the ball and to guard his wicket, clause 20.4.2.6 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball) shall apply. If, however, either umpire considers that the interference by the wicket-keeper was wilful, then clause 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to distract striker) shall also apply. 27.6 Interference with wicket-keeper by striker If, in playing at the ball or in the legitimate defence of his wicket, the striker interferes with the wicket-keeper, he shall not be out except as provided for in clause 37.3 (Obstructing a ball from being caught). 28 THE FIELDER 28.1 Protective equipment No fielder other than the wicket-keeper shall be permitted to wear gloves or external leg guards. In addition, protection for the hand or fingers may be worn only with the consent of the umpires. 28.2 Fielding the ball 28.2.1 A fielder may field the ball with any part of his person (see paragraph 12 of Appendix A), except as in clause 28.2.1.2. However, he will be deemed to have fielded the ball illegally if, while the ball is in play he wilfully 28.2.1.1 uses anything other than part of his person to field the ball. 28.2.1.2 extends his clothing with his hands and uses this to field the ball. 28.2.1.3 discards a piece of clothing, equipment or any other object which subsequently makes contact with the ball. 28.2.2 It is not illegal fielding if the ball in play makes contact with a piece of clothing, equipment or any other object which has accidentally fallen from the fielder’s person, or been dropped by an umpire. 28.2.3 If a fielder illegally fields the ball, the ball shall immediately become dead and - the penalty for a No ball or a Wide shall stand. - any runs completed by the batters shall be credited to the batting side, together with the run in progress if the batters had already crossed at the instant of the offence. - the ball shall not count as one of the over. In addition the umpire shall: - award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. - inform the other umpire and the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. - inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. 28.3 Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side 28.3.1 Protective helmets, when not in use by fielders, may not be placed on the ground, above the surface except behind the wicket-keeper and in line with both sets of stumps. 28.3.2 If the ball while in play strikes the protective helmet, placed as described in clause 28.3.1 the ball shall immediately become Dead and, unless 28.3.3. applies: the umpire shall signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers, if applicable the umpire shall award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side; 43 28.3.2.1 any runs completed by the batters before the ball strikes the protective helmet shall be scored, together with the run in progress if the batters had already crossed at the instant of the ball striking the protective helmet. 28.3.3 If the ball while in play strikes the protective helmet, placed as described in clause 28.3.1, and the circumstances of clause 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded) or clause 34 (Hit the ball twice) apply, the umpire shall: - disallow all runs to the batting side - return any not out batter to his original end - signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers if applicable - award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3.2. 28.4 Limitation of on side fielders 28.4.1 At the instant of delivery, there may not be more than 5 fielders on the leg side. 28.4.2 At the instant of the bowler’s delivery there shall not be more than two fielders, other than the wicket-keeper, behind the popping crease on the on side. A fielder will be considered to be behind the popping crease unless the whole of his person whether grounded or in the air is in front of this line. 28.4.3 In the event of infringement of this clause by any fielder, the striker’s end umpire shall call and signal No ball. 28.5 Fielders not to encroach on pitch While the ball is in play and until the ball has made contact with the striker’s bat or person, or has passed the striker’s bat, no fielder, other than the bowler, may have any part of his person grounded on or extended over the pitch. In the event of infringement of this clause by any fielder other than the wicket-keeper, the bowler’s end umpire shall call and signal No ball as soon as possible after delivery of the ball. Note, however, clause 27.3 (Position of wicketkeeper). 28.6 Movement by any fielder other than the wicket-keeper 28.6.1 Any movement by any fielder, excluding the wicket-keeper, after the ball comes into play and before the ball reaches the striker, is unfair except for the following: 28.6.1.1 minor adjustments to stance or position in relation to the striker’s wicket. 28.6.1.2 movement by any fielder, other than a close fielder, towards the striker or the striker’s wicket that does not significantly alter the position of the fielder. 28.6.1.3 movement by any fielder in response to the stroke that the striker is playing or that his actions suggest he intends to play. 28.6.2 In all circumstances clause 28.4 (Limitation of on side fielders) shall apply. 28.6.3 In the event of such unfair movement, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for doing so. The bowler’s end umpire shall then: 28.6.3.1 award the one-run penalty for Wide or No ball, if applicable 28.6.3.2 award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side 28.6.3.3 inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. 28.6.3.4 inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. The umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the ICC Match Referee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the fielder concerned. 44 28.6.4 Note also the provisions of clause 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to distract striker). See also clause 27.4 (Movement by wicket-keeper). 28.7 Restrictions on the placement of fielders 28.7.1 In addition to the restrictions contained in clause 28.4 above, further fielding restrictions shall apply to certain overs in each innings. The nature of such fielding restrictions and the overs during which they shall apply are set out in the following paragraphs. 28.7.2 The following fielding restrictions shall apply: 28.7.2.1 Two semi-circles shall be drawn on the field of play. The semi-circles shall have as their centre the middle stump at either end of the pitch. The radius of each of the semi-circles shall be 30 yards (27.43 metres). The semi-circles shall be linked by two parallel straight lines drawn on the field. (Refer to paragraph 2 of Appendix C). The fielding restriction areas should be marked by continuous painted white lines or ‘dots’ at 5 yard (4.57 metres) intervals, each ‘dot’ to be covered by a white plastic or rubber (but not metal) disc measuring 7 inches (18 cm) in diameter. 28.7.2.2 At the instant of delivery: 28.7.2.2.1 Powerplay 1 - no more than two (2) fielders shall be permitted outside this fielding restriction area. In an innings of 50 overs, these are overs 1 to 10 inclusive. 28.7.2.2.2 Powerplay 2 - no more than four (4) fielders shall be permitted outside this fielding restriction area. In an innings of 50 overs, these are overs 11 to 40 inclusive 28.7.2.2.3 Powerplay 3 - no more than five (5) fielders shall be permitted outside this fielding restriction area. In an innings of 50 overs, these are overs 41 to 50 inclusive 28.7.2.3 In circumstances when the number of overs of the batting team is reduced, the number of overs within each phase of the innings shall be reduced in accordance with the table below. For the sake of clarity, it should be noted that the table shall apply to both the 1st and 2nd innings of the match. Innings duration Powerplay 1 Powerplay 2 Powerplay 3 20 4 12 4 21 4 13 4 22 5 13 4 23 5 14 4 24 5 14 5 25 5 15 5 26 5 16 5 27 6 16 5 28 6 17 5 29 6 17 6 30 6 18 6 31 6 19 6 32 7 19 6 33 7 20 6 34 7 20 7 35 7 21 7 36 7 22 7 37 8 22 7 38 8 23 7 39 8 23 8 40 8 24 8 41 8 25 8 42 9 25 8 43 9 26 8 44 9 26 9 45 9 27 9 45 46 9 28 9 47 10 28 9 48 10 29 9 49 10 29 10 28.7.2.4 If play is interrupted during an innings and the table above applies, the Powerplay takes immediate effect. For the avoidance of doubt this applies even if the interruption has occurred mid-over. Illustrations: A 50 over innings is interrupted after 8.3 overs and reduced to 32 overs. The new phases are 7+19+6. Therefore the middle phase fielding restrictions take immediate effect when play resumes and last for a further 17.3 overs. The final phase begins after 26 overs have been bowled. A 40 over innings is interrupted after 18.5 overs and reduced to 22 overs. The new phases are 5+13+4. When play resumes, the final phase fielding restrictions apply for the remaining 3.1 overs. 28.7.2.5 At the commencement of the middle and final phases of an innings, the umpire shall signal such commencement to the scorers by rotating his arm in a large circle. 28.7.2.6 The scoreboard shall indicate the current Powerplay in progress. 28.7.2.7 In the event of an infringement of any of the above fielding restrictions, the square leg umpire shall call and signal No ball. 29 THE WICKET IS BROKEN 29.1 Wicket put down The wicket is broken when at least one bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps, or one or more stumps is removed from the ground. 29.2 Breaking the wicket fairly 29.2.1 The wicket is broken fairly if a bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps or a stump is struck out of the ground. 29.2.1.1 by the ball, 29.2.1.2 by the striker’s bat if held or by any part of the bat that he is holding, 29.2.1.3 for the purpose of this clause only, by the striker\\'s bat not in hand, or by any part of the bat which has become detached, 29.2.1.4 by the striker’s person or by any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached from his person, 29.2.1.5 by a fielder with his hand or arm, providing that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used. 29.2.1.6 The wicket is also broken fairly if a fielder strikes or pulls a stump out of the ground as in clause 29.1.2.5. 29.2 2 The disturbance of a bail, whether temporary or not, shall not constitute its complete removal from the top of the stumps, but if a bail in falling lodges between two of the stumps this shall be regarded as complete removal. 29.3 One bail off If one bail is off, it shall be sufficient for the purpose of breaking the wicket to remove the remaining bail or to strike or pull any of the three stumps out of the ground, in any of the ways stated in clause 29.1. 46 29.4 Remaking wicket If a wicket is broken or put down while the ball is in play, it shall not be remade by an umpire until the ball is dead. See clause 20 (Dead ball). Any fielder may, however, while the ball is in play, - replace a bail or bails on top of the stumps. - put back one or more stumps into the ground where the wicket originally stood. 29.5 Dispensing with bails If the umpires have agreed to dispense with bails in accordance with clause 8.4 (Dispensing with bails), it is for the umpire concerned to decide whether or not the wicket has been broken. 29.5.1 After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been broken fairly if the umpire concerned is satisfied that the wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker’s bat, person or items of his clothing or equipment as described in clauses 29.2.1.2, 29.2.1.3 or 29.2.1.4, or by a fielder in the manner described in clause 29.2.1.5. 29.5.2 If the wicket has already been broken or put down, clause 29.5.1 shall apply to any stump or stumps still in the ground. Any fielder may replace a stump or stumps, in accordance with clause 29.4, in order to have an opportunity of breaking the wicket fairly. 30 BATTER OUT OF HIS GROUND 30.1 When out of his ground 30.1.1 A batter shall be considered to be out of his ground unless some part of his person or bat is grounded behind the popping crease at that end. 30.1.2 However, a batter shall not be considered to be out of his ground if, in running or diving towards his ground and beyond, and having grounded some part of his person or bat beyond the popping crease, there is subsequent loss of contact between the ground and any part of his person or bat, or between the bat and person. 30.2 Which is a batter’s ground 30.2.1 If only one batter is within a ground, it is his ground and will remain so even if he is later joined there by the other batter. 30.2.2 If both batters are in the same ground and one of them subsequently leaves it, the ground belongs to the batter who remains in it. 30.2.3 If there is no batter in either ground, then each ground belongs to whichever batter is nearer to it, or, if the batters are level, to whichever batter was nearer to it immediately prior to their drawing level. 30.2.4 If a ground belongs to one batter then the other ground belongs to the other batter, irrespective of his position. 30.3 Position of non-striker The non-striker, when standing at the bowler’s end, should be positioned on the opposite side of the wicket to that from which the ball is being delivered, unless a request to do otherwise is granted by the umpire. 31 APPEALS 31.1 Umpire not to give batter out without an appeal Neither umpire shall give a batter out, even though he may be out under these Playing Conditions, unless appealed to by a fielder. This shall not debar a batter who is out under these Playing Conditions from leaving the wicket without an appeal having been made. Note, however, the provisions of clause 31.7. 47 31.2 Batter dismissed A batter is dismissed if he is either given out by an umpire, on appeal or out under these Playing Conditions and leaves the wicket as in clause 31.1. 31.3 Timing of appeals For an appeal to be valid, it must be made before the bowler begins his run-up or, if there is no run-up, his bowling action to deliver the next ball, and before Time has been called. The call of Over does not invalidate an appeal made prior to the start of the following over, provided Time has not been called. See clauses 12.2 (Call of Time) and 17.2 (Start of an over). 31.4 Appeal “How’s That?” An appeal “How’s That?” covers all ways of being out. Refer also to Appendix D – DRS and Third Umpire Protocol. 31.5 Answering appeals The striker’s end umpire shall answer all appeals arising out of any of clauses 35 (Hit wicket), 39 (Stumped) or 38 (Run out) when this occurs at the wicket-keeper’s end. The bowler’s end umpire shall answer all other appeals. When an appeal is made, each umpire shall answer on any matter that falls within his jurisdiction. When a batter has been given Not out, either umpire may answer an appeal, made in accordance with clause 31.3, if it is on a further matter and is within his jurisdiction. 31.6 Consultation by umpires Each umpire shall answer appeals on matters within his/her own jurisdiction. If an umpire is doubtful about any point that the other umpire may have been in a better position to see, he/she shall consult the latter on this point of fact and shall then give the decision. If, after consultation, there is still doubt remaining, the decision shall be Not out. 31.7 Batter leaving the wicket under a misapprehension An umpire shall intervene if satisfied that a batter, not having been given out, has left the wicket under a misapprehension of being out. The umpire intervening shall call and signal Dead ball to prevent any further action by the fielding side and shall recall the batter. A batter may be recalled at any time up to the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery, unless it is the final wicket of the innings, in which case it should be up to the instant when the umpires leave the field. 31.8 Withdrawal of an appeal The captain of the fielding side may withdraw an appeal only after obtaining the consent of the umpire within whose jurisdiction the appeal falls. If such consent is given, the umpire concerned shall, if applicable, revoke the decision and recall the batter. The withdrawal of an appeal must be before the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery or, if the innings has been completed, the instant when the umpires leave the field. 32 BOWLED 32.1 Out Bowled 32.1.1 The striker is out Bowled if his wicket is broken by a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a No ball, even if it first touches the striker’s bat or person. 48 32.1.2 However, the striker shall not be out Bowled if before striking the wicket the ball has been in contact with any other player or an umpire. The striker will, however, be subject to clauses 37 (Obstructing the field), 38 (Run out) and 39 (Stumped). 32.2 Bowled to take precedence The striker is out Bowled if his wicket is broken as in clause 32.1, even though a decision against him for any other method of dismissal would be justified. 33 CAUGHT 33.1 Out Caught The striker is out Caught if a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a No ball, touches his bat without having previously been in contact with any fielder, and is subsequently held by a fielder as a fair catch, as described in clauses 33.2 and 33.3, before it touches the ground. 33.2 A fair catch 33.2.1 A catch will be fair only if, in every case either the ball, at any time or any fielder in contact with the ball, is not grounded beyond the boundary before the catch is completed. Note clauses 19.4 (Ball grounded beyond the boundary) and 19.5 (Fielder grounded beyond the boundary). 33.2.2 Furthermore, a catch will be fair if any of the following conditions applies: 33.2.2.1 the ball is held in the hand or hands of a fielder, even if the hand holding the ball is touching the ground, or is hugged to the body, or lodges in the external protective equipment worn by a fielder, or lodges accidentally in a fielder’s clothing. 33.2.2.2 a fielder catches the ball after it has been lawfully struck more than once by the striker, but only if it has not been grounded since it was first struck. See clause 34 (Hit the ball twice). 33.2.2.3 a fielder catches the ball after it has touched the wicket, an umpire, another fielder or the other batter. 33.2.2.4 a fielder catches the ball after it has crossed the boundary in the air, provided that the conditions in clause 33.2.1 are met. 33.2.2.5 the ball is caught off an obstruction within the boundary that is not designated a boundary by the umpires. 33.3 Making a catch The act of making a catch shall start from the time when the ball first comes into contact with a fielder’s person and shall end when a fielder obtains complete control over both the ball and his own movement. 33.4 No runs to be scored If the striker is dismissed Caught, runs from that delivery completed by the batters before the completion of the catch shall not be scored but any runs for penalties awarded to either side shall stand. The non-striker shall return to his original end. See clause 18.11 Batter returning to original end. 33.5 Caught to take precedence If the criteria of clause 33.1 are met and the striker is not out Bowled, then he is out Caught, even though a decision against either batter for another method of dismissal would be justified. 49 34 HIT THE BALL TWICE 34.1 Out Hit the ball twice 34.1.1 The striker is out Hit the ball twice if, while the ball is in play, it strikes any part of his person or is struck by his bat and, before the ball has been touched by a fielder, the striker wilfully strikes it again with his bat or person, other than a hand not holding the bat, except for the sole purpose of guarding his wicket. See clause 34.3 and clause 37 (Obstructing the field). 34.1.2 For the purpose of this clause ‘struck’ or ‘strike’ shall include contact with the person of the striker. 34.1.3 This clause will apply whether or not No ball is called. 34.2 Not out Hit the ball twice The striker will not be out under this clause if he 34.2.1 strikes the ball a second or subsequent time in order to return the ball to any fielder. Note, however, the provisions of clause 37.4 (Returning the ball to a fielder). 34.2.2 wilfully strikes the ball after it has touched a fielder. Note, however the provisions of clause 37.1 (Out Obstructing the field). 34.3 Ball lawfully struck more than once The striker may, solely in order to guard his wicket and before the ball has been touched by a fielder, lawfully strike the ball a second or subsequent time with the bat, or with any part of his person other than a hand not holding the bat. The striker may guard his wicket even if the delivery is a No ball. However, the striker may not prevent the ball from being caught by striking the ball more than once in defence of his wicket. See clause 37.3 (Obstructing a ball from being caught). 34.4 Runs permitted from ball lawfully struck more than once When the ball is lawfully struck more than once, as permitted in clause 34.3, if the ball does not become dead for any reason, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball as soon as the ball reaches the boundary or at the completion of the first run. However, the umpire shall delay the call of Dead ball to allow the opportunity for a catch to be completed. The umpire shall - disallow all runs to the batting side - return any not out batter to his original end - signal No ball to the scorers if applicable, and - award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side). 34.5 Bowler does not get credit The bowler does not get credit for the wicket. 35 HIT WICKET 35.1 Out Hit wicket 35.1.1 The striker is out Hit wicket if, after the bowler has entered the delivery stride and while the ball is in play, his wicket is broken by either the striker’s bat or person as described in clauses 29.2.1.2 to 29.2.1.4 ( Breaking the wicket fairly) in any of the following circumstances: 50 35.1.1.1 in the course of any action taken by him in preparing to receive or in receiving a delivery, 35.1.1.2 in setting off for the first run immediately after playing or playing at the ball, 35.1.1.3 if no attempt is made to play the ball, in setting off for the first run, providing that in the opinion of the umpire this is immediately after the striker has had the opportunity of playing the ball, 35.1.1.4 in lawfully making a second or further stroke for the purpose of guarding his wicket within the provisions of clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once). 35.1.2 If the striker breaks his wicket in any of the ways described in clauses 29.2.1.2 to 29.2.1.4 (Breaking the wicket fairly) before the bowler has entered the delivery stride, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball. 35.2 Not out Hit wicket The striker is not out under this clause should his wicket be put down in any of the ways referred to in clause 35.1 if any of the following applies: - it occurs after the striker has completed any action in receiving the delivery, other than in clauses 35.1.1.2 to 35.1.1.4. - it occurs when the striker is in the act of running, other than setting off immediately for the first run. - it occurs when the striker is trying to avoid being run out or stumped. - it occurs when the striker is trying to avoid a throw in at any time. - the bowler after entering the delivery stride does not deliver the ball. In this case either umpire shall immediately call and signal Dead ball. See clause 20.4 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball). - the delivery is a No ball. 35.3 Runs scored No runs shall be scored when the striker is dismissed Hit wicket other than the one-run penalty for a Wide and any award of 5 Penalty Runs. 36 LEG BEFORE WICKET 36.1 Out LBW The striker is out LBW if all the circumstances set out in clauses 36.1.1 to 36.1.5 apply. 36.1.1 The bowler delivers a ball, not being a No ball 36.1.2 the ball, if it is not intercepted full-pitch, pitches in line between wicket and wicket or on the off side of the striker’s wicket 36.1.3 the ball not having previously touched his bat, the striker intercepts the ball, either full-pitch or after pitching, with any part of his person 36.1.4 the point of impact, even if above the level of the bails, either is between wicket and wicket or if the striker has made no genuine attempt to play the ball with the bat, is between wicket and wicket or outside the line of the off stump. 36.1.5 but for the interception, the ball would have hit the wicket. 36.2 Interception of the ball 36.2.1 In assessing points of impact in clauses 36.1.3, 36.1.4 and 36.1.5, only the first interception is to be considered. 51 36.2.2 In assessing clause 36.1.3, if the bowler’s end umpire is not satisfied that the ball intercepted the batter’s person before it touched the bat, the batter shall be given Not out. 36.2.3 In assessing clause 36.1.5, it is to be assumed that the path of the ball before interception would have continued after interception, irrespective of whether the ball might have pitched subsequently or not. 36.3 Off side of wicket The off side of the striker’s wicket shall be determined by the striker’s batting position at the moment the ball comes into play for that delivery. See paragraph 13 of Appendix A. 37 OBSTRUCTING THE FIELD 37.1 Out Obstructing the field 37.1.1 Either batter is out Obstructing the field if, except in the circumstances of clause 37.2, and while the ball is in play, he wilfully attempts to obstruct or distract the fielding side by word or action. See also clause 34 (Hit the ball twice). 37.1.2 The striker is out Obstructing the field if, except in the circumstances of clause 37.2, in the act of receiving a ball delivered by the bowler, he wilfully strikes the ball with a hand not holding the bat. This will apply whether it is the first strike or a second or subsequent strike. The act of receiving the ball shall extend both to playing at the ball and to striking the ball more than once in defence of his wicket. 37.1.3 This clause will apply whether or not No ball is called. 37.1.4 For the avoidance of doubt, if an umpire feels that a batter, in running between the wickets, has significantly changed his direction without probable cause and thereby obstructed a fielder’s attempt to effect a run out, the batter should, on appeal, be given out, obstructing the field. It shall not be relevant whether a run out would have occurred or not. If the change of direction involves the batter crossing the pitch, clause 41.14 shall also apply. See also paragraph 2.2 of Appendix D. 37.2 Not out Obstructing the field A batter shall not be out Obstructing the field if obstruction or distraction is accidental, or obstruction is in order to avoid injury, or in the case of the striker, he makes a second or subsequent strike to guard his wicket lawfully as in clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once). However, see clause 37.3. 37.3 Obstructing a ball from being caught 37.3.1 If the delivery is not a No ball, the striker is out Obstructing the field if wilful obstruction or distraction by either batter prevents the striker being out caught. 37.3.2 Clause 37.3.1 shall apply even if an obstruction is caused by the striker in lawfully guarding his wicket under the provision of Clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once). 37.3.3 If an obstruction or distraction takes place from a No ball then the batter who caused the obstruction or distraction will be out Obstructing the field. However, the striker is not out if the obstruction of a catch occurs while defending his/her wicket from a No ball with a lawful second strike. 52 37.4 Returning the ball to a fielder Either batter is out Obstructing the field if, at any time while the ball is in play and, without the consent of a fielder, he uses the bat or any part of his person to return the ball to any fielder. 37.5 Runs scored When either batter is dismissed Obstructing the field, 37.5.1 unless the obstruction or distraction prevents the striker being out caught, any runs completed by the batters before the offence shall be scored, together with any one run Penalty for No ball or wide, or any other award of 5 Penalty Runs to either side. See clauses 18.6 (Runs awarded for penalties) and 18.8 (Runs scored when a batter is dismissed). 37.5.2 if the obstruction or distraction prevents the striker being out caught, any runs completed by the batters shall not be scored but any award of 5 Penalty Runs to either side shall stand. Clause 18.11 (Batter returning to original end) will apply. 37.6 Bowler does not get credit The bowler does not get credit for the wicket. 38 RUN OUT 38.1 Out Run out Either batter is out Run out, except as in clause 38.2, if, at any time while the ball is in play, he is out of his ground and his wicket is fairly broken by either the action of a fielder or the ball rebounding off a fielder’s person even though No ball has been called, except in the circumstances of clause 38.2.2.2, and whether or not a run is being attempted. 38.2 Batter not out Run out 38.2.1 A batter is not out Run out in the circumstances of clauses 38.2.1.1 or 38.2.1.2. 38.2.1.1 He has been within his ground and has subsequently left it to avoid injury, when the wicket is broken. Note also the provisions of clause 30.1.2 (When out of his ground). 38.2.1.2 The ball delivered by the bowler has not made contact with a fielder, before the wicket is put down. 38.2.2 The striker is not out Run out in any of the circumstances in clauses 38.2.2.1 and 38.2.2.2. 38.2.2.1 He is out Stumped. See clause 39.1.2 (Out Stumped). 38.2.2.2 No ball has been called and he is out of his ground not attempting a run and the wicket is fairly broken by the wicket-keeper without the intervention of another fielder. 38.3 Non-striker leaving his/her ground early 38.3.1 If the non-striker is out of his/her ground at any time from the moment the ball comes into play until the instant when the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball, the nonstriker is liable to be Run out by the bowler attempting to run him/her out. In these circumstances, the non- striker will be out Run out if he/she is out of his/her ground when his/her wicket is broken by the bowler throwing the ball at the wicket or by the bowler’s hand holding the ball, whether or not the ball 53 is subsequently delivered. 38.3.2 If the ball is not delivered, - if there is an appeal, the umpire shall make his/her decision on the Run out. - if there is no appeal, or if the decision is not out, he/she shall call and signal Dead ball as soon as possible. - the ball shall not count as one in the over. 38.3.3 If the ball is delivered and there is an appeal, - the umpire shall make his/her decision on the Run out. - if the non-striker is not dismissed, the ball remains in play and clause 21.6 (Bowler breaking wicket in delivering ball) shall apply. - if the non-striker is dismissed, the ball shall not count as one in the over. 38.4 Which batter is out The batter out in the circumstances of clause 38.1 is the one whose ground is at the end where the wicket is put down. See clause 30.2 (Which is a batter’s ground). 38.5 Runs scored If either batter is dismissed Run out, the run in progress when the wicket is put down shall not be scored, but any runs completed by the batters shall stand, together with any runs for penalties awarded to either side. See clauses 18.6 (Runs awarded for penalties) and 18.8 (Runs scored when a batter is dismissed). 38.6 Bowler does not get credit The bowler does not get credit for the wicket. 39 STUMPED 39.1 Out Stumped 39.1.1 The striker is out Stumped, except as in clause 39.3, if a ball which is delivered is not called No ball and he is out of his ground, other than as in clause 39.3.1 and he has not attempted a run when his wicket is fairly broken by the wicket-keeper without the intervention of another fielder. Note, however clause 27.3 (Position of wicket-keeper). 39.1.2 The striker is out Stumped if all the conditions of clause 39.1.1 are satisfied, even though a decision of Run out would be justified. 39.2 Ball rebounding from wicket-keeper’s person If the wicket is broken by the ball, it shall be regarded as having been put down by the wicket-keeper if the ball rebounds on to the stumps from any part of the wicket-keeper’s person or equipment or has been kicked or thrown on to the stumps by the wicket-keeper. 39.3 Not out Stumped 39.3.1 The striker will not be out Stumped if, after having received the delivery, he has left his ground in order to avoid injury. 54 39.3.2 If the striker is not out Stumped he may, except in the circumstances of clause 38.2.2.2 (Batter not out run out) be out Run out if the conditions of clause 38.1 (Out Run out) apply. 39.4 Runs Scored When a striker is dismissed Stumped from a Wide ball, the one-run penalty shall stand. Note clauses 12.9 (Conclusion of match), 16.6 (Winning hit or extras) and 22.2 (Call and signal of Wide ball) mean that if the penalty for a Wide concludes the match, then a stumping is not possible, but the one-run penalty for the Wide remains. 40 TIMED OUT 40.1 Out Timed out 40.1.1 After the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, the incoming batter must, unless Time has been called, be ready to receive the ball or for the other batter to be ready to receive the next ball within 2 minutes of the dismissal or retirement. If this requirement is not met, the incoming batter will be out, Timed out. 40.1.2 In the event of an extended delay in which no batter comes to the wicket, the umpires shall adopt the procedure of clause 16.2 (ICC Match Referee awarding a match). For the purposes of that clause the start of the action shall be taken as the expiry of the 2 minutes referred to above. 40.2 Bowler does not get credit The bowler does not get credit for the wicket. 41 UNFAIR PLAY 41.1 Fair and unfair play – responsibility of captains The captains are responsible for ensuring that play is conducted within the Spirit of Cricket, as well as within these Playing Conditions. 41.2 Fair and unfair play – responsibility of umpires 41.2.1 The umpires shall be the sole judges of fair and unfair play. If either umpire considers that any action by a player, not covered by these Playing Conditions, is unfair, he/she shall call and signal Dead ball, if appropriate, as soon as it becomes clear that the call will not disadvantage the non-offending side, and report the matter to the other umpire. 41.2.1.1 If this is a first offence by that side, the bowler’s end umpire shall then - summon the offending player’s captain and issue a first and final warning which shall apply to all members of the team for the remainder of the match. - warn the offending player’s captain that any further such offence by any member of his team shall result in the award of 5 Penalty runs to the opposing team. 41.2.1.2 If this is a second or subsequent offence by that side the bowler’s end umpire shall then - summon the offending player’s captain and inform him that there has been a further such offence. - award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side. 41.2.1.3 The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the player concerned. 55 41.3 The match ball – changing its condition 41.3.1 The umpires shall make frequent and irregular inspections of the ball. In addition, they shall immediately inspect the ball if they suspect anyone of attempting to change the condition of the ball, except as permitted in clause 41.3.2. 41.3.2 It is an offence for any player to take any action which changes the condition of the ball. Except in carrying out his normal duties, a batter is not allowed to wilfully damage the ball other than, when the ball is in play, in striking it with the bat. See also clause 5.5 (Damage to the ball). A fielder may, however: 41.3.2.1 polish the ball on his clothing provided that no artificial substance is used, that the only natural substance used is sweat, and that such polishing wastes no time. 41.3.2.2 remove mud from the ball under the supervision of an umpire. 41.3.2.3 dry a wet ball on a piece of cloth that has been approved by the umpires. 41.3.3 The umpires shall consider the condition of the ball to have been unfairly changed if any action by any player does not comply with the conditions in clause 41.3.2. 41.3.4 If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly changed by a member or members of either side, or that its condition is inconsistent with the use it has received, they shall consider that there has been a contravention of this clause and decide together whether they can identify the player(s) responsible for such conduct. 41.3.5 If it is possible to identify the player(s) responsible for changing the condition of the ball, the umpires shall: 41.3.5.1 Subject to clause 41.3.2 above, change the ball forthwith. 41.3.5.1.1 If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly changed by a member or members of the fielding side, the batter at the wicket shall choose the replacement ball from a selection of six other balls of various degrees of usage (including a new ball) and of the same brand as the ball in use prior to the contravention. 41.3.5.1.2 If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly changed by a member or members of the batting side, the umpires shall select and bring into use immediately, a ball which shall have wear comparable to that of the previous ball immediately prior to the contravention. 41.3.5.2 Additionally, the bowler’s end umpire shall: 41.3.5.2.1 award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side; 41.3.5.2.2 if appropriate, inform the batters at the wicket and the captain of the fielding side that the ball has been changed and the reason for their action; and 41.3.5.2.3 inform the captain of the batting side as soon as practicable of what has occurred. 41.3.5.3 The umpires shall then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the player(s) concerned. 41.3.6 If it is not possible to identify the player(s) responsible for changing the condition of the ball, the umpires shall: 56 41.3.6.1 Change the ball forthwith. The umpires shall choose the replacement ball for one of similar wear and of the same brand as the ball in use prior to the contravention; 41.3.6.2 The bowler’s end umpire shall issue the captain with a first and final warning, and 41.3.6.3 Advise the captain that should there be any further instances of changing the condition of the ball by that team during the remainder of the series, clause 41.3.5.1.2 above will be adopted, with the captain deemed to be the player responsible for the contravention. 41.4 Deliberate attempt to distract striker 41.4.1 It is unfair for any fielder deliberately to attempt to distract the striker while he is preparing to receive or receiving a delivery. 41.4.2 If either umpire considers that any action by a fielder is such an attempt, he/she shall immediately call and signal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. The bowler’s end umpire shall - award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. - inform the captain of the fielding side, the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the reason for the action. Neither batter shall be dismissed from that delivery and the ball shall not count as one of the over. However, if either umpire had reason to call and signal No ball, he/she shall do so regardless of the attempt to distract, and this call shall stand The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the fielder concerned. 41.5 Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter 41.5.1 In addition to clause 41.4, it is unfair for any fielder wilfully to attempt, by word or action, to distract, deceive or obstruct either batter after the striker has received the ball. 41.5.2 It is for either one of the umpires to decide whether any distraction, deception or obstruction is wilful or not. 41.5.3 If either umpire considers that a fielder has caused or attempted to cause such a distraction, deception or obstruction, he/she shall immediately call and signal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. 41.5.4 Neither batter shall be dismissed from that delivery. 41.5.5 If an obstruction involves physical contact, the umpires together shall decide whether or not an offence under clause 42 (Players’ conduct) has been committed. 41.5.5.1 If an offence under clause 42 (Players’ conduct) has been committed, they shall apply the relevant procedures in clause 42 and shall also apply each of clauses 41.5.7 to 41.5.9. 41.5.5.2 If they consider that there has been no offence under clause 42 (Players’ conduct), they shall apply each of clauses 41.5.6 to 41.5.10. 41.5.6 The bowler’s end umpire shall; - Signal No ball or Wide to the scorers, if applicable. - award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. - inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action and as soon as practicable inform the captain of the batting side. 41.5.7 The ball shall not count as one of the over. 41.5.8 Any runs completed by the batters before the offence shall be scored, together with any runs for penalties awarded to either side. Additionally, the run in progress shall be scored whether or not the batters had already crossed at the instant of the offence. 57 41.5.9 The batters at the wicket shall decide which of them is to face the next delivery. 41.5.10 The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the fielder concerned. 41.6 Bowling of dangerous and unfair short pitched deliveries 41.6.1 Notwithstanding clause 41.6.2, the bowling of short pitched deliveries is dangerous if the bowler’s end umpire considers that, taking into consideration the skill of the striker, by their speed, length, height and direction they are likely to inflict physical injury on him. The fact that the striker is wearing protective equipment shall be disregarded. In the first instance the umpire decides that the bowling of short pitched deliveries has become dangerous under clause 41.6.1 41.6.1.1 The umpire shall call and signal No ball, and when the ball is dead, caution the bowler and inform the other umpire, the captain of the fielding side and the batters of what has occurred. This caution shall apply to that bowler throughout the innings. 41.6.1.2 If there is a second instance, the umpire shall repeat the above procedure and indicate to the bowler that this is a final warning, which shall apply to that bowler throughout the innings. 41.6.1.3 Should there be any further instance by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall - call and signal No ball - when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling - inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. The bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. If applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. - The umpire shall inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. 41.6.1.4 A bowler shall be limited to two fast short-pitched deliveries per over. 41.6.1.5 A fast short-pitched delivery is defined as a ball, which passes or would have passed above the shoulder height of the striker standing upright at the popping crease. 41.6.1.6 The umpire at the bowler’s end shall advise the bowler and the batter on strike when each fast short pitched delivery has been bowled. 41.6.1.7 In addition, a ball that passes above head height of the batter, standing upright at the popping crease, that prevents him from being able to hit it with his bat by means of a normal cricket stroke shall be called a Wide. See also clause 22.1.1.2 41.6.1.7.1 For the avoidance of doubt any fast short pitched delivery that is called a Wide under this clause shall also count as one of the allowable short pitched deliveries in that over. 41.6.1.8 In the event of a bowler bowling more than two fast short-pitched deliveries in an over as defined in clause 41.6.1.5 above, the umpire at the bowler’s end shall call and signal No ball on each occasion. A differential signal shall be used to signify a fast short pitched delivery. The umpire shall call and signal ‘No ball’ and then tap the head with the other hand. 41.6.1.9 If a bowler delivers a third fast short pitched ball in an over, the umpire, after the call of No ball and when the ball is dead, shall caution the bowler, inform the other umpire, the captain of the fielding side and the batters at the wicket of what has occurred. This caution shall apply throughout the innings. 58 41.6.1.10 If there is a second instance of the bowler being No balled in the innings for bowling more than two fast short pitched deliveries in an over, the umpire shall advise the bowler that this is his final warning for the innings. 41.6.1.11 Should there be any further instance by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall - call and signal No ball - when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling - inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. The bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. If applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. - The umpire shall inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. 41.6.2 Should the umpires initiate the caution and warning procedures set out in clauses 41.6.1.3 and 41.7 such cautions and warnings are not to be cumulative. 41.7 Bowling of dangerous and unfair non-pitching deliveries 41.7.1 Any delivery, which passes or would have passed, without pitching, above waist height of the striker standing upright at the popping crease, is to be deemed to be unfair, whether or not it is likely to inflict physical injury on the striker. If the bowler bowls such a delivery the umpire shall immediately call and signal No ball. If, in the opinion of the umpire, such a delivery is considered likely to inflict physical injury on the batter by its speed and direction, it shall be considered dangerous. When the ball is dead the umpire shall caution the bowler, indicating that this is a first and final warning. The umpire shall also inform the other umpire, the captain of the fielding side and the batters of what has occurred. This caution shall apply to that bowler throughout the innings. 41.7.2 Should there be any further instance (where a dangerous non-pitching delivery is bowled and is considered likely to inflict physical injury on the batter) by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall - call and signal No ball - when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling - inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. The bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. If applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. Additionally the umpire shall - report the occurrence to the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. 41.7.3 The warning sequence in clauses 41.7.1 and 41.7.2 is independent of the warning and action sequence in clause 41.6. 59 41.7.4 If the umpire considers that a bowler deliberately bowled a high full-pitched delivery, deemed to be dangerous and unfair as defined in clause 41.7.1, then the caution and warning in clause 41.7.1 shall be dispensed with. The umpire shall - immediately call and signal No ball. - when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling and inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. The bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. If applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. - report the occurrence to the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. The umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. 41.8 Bowling of deliberate front-foot No ball If the umpire considers that the bowler has delivered a deliberate front-foot No ball, he/she shall - immediately call and signal No ball. - when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling - inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. The bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings.

The umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. 41.9 Time wasting by the fielding side 41.9.1 It is unfair for any fielder to waste time. 41.9.2 If either umpire considers that the progress of an over is unnecessarily slow, or time is being wasted in any other way, by the captain of the fielding side or by any other fielder, at the first instance the umpire concerned shall - if the ball is in play, call and signal Dead ball. - inform the other umpire of what has occurred. The bowler’s end umpire shall then - warn the captain of the fielding side, indicating that this is a first and final warning. - inform the batters of what has occurred. 41.9.3 If either umpire considers that there is any further waste of time in that innings by any fielder, the umpire concerned shall - if the ball is in play, call and signal Dead ball. - inform the other umpire of what has occurred. 60 The bowler’s end umpire shall then award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side and inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. Additionally the umpire shall inform the batters and, as soon as is practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. If the umpires believe that the act of time wasting was deliberate or repetitive, they may lodge a report under the ICC Code of Conduct. In such circumstances the Captain and/or any individual members of the fielding team responsible for the time wasting will be charged. 41.10Batter wasting time 41.10.1 It is unfair for a batter to waste time. In normal circumstances, the striker should always be ready to take strike when the bowler is ready to start his run-up. In addition, an incoming batter should be in position to take guard or his partner ready to receive the next ball within 2 minutes of the fall of the previous wicket. 41.10.2 Should either batter waste time by failing to meet this requirement, or in any other way, the following procedure shall be adopted. At the first instance, either before the bowler starts his run-up or when the ball becomes dead, as appropriate, the umpire shall - warn both batters and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall apply throughout the innings. The umpire shall so inform each incoming batter. - inform the other umpire of what has occurred. - inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. 41.10.3 If there is any further time wasting by any batter in that innings, the umpire shall, at the appropriate time while the ball is dead - award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. - inform the other umpire of the reason for this action. - inform the other batter, the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. If the umpires believe that the act of time wasting was deemed to be deliberate or repetitive, they may lodge a report under the ICC Code of Conduct. In such circumstances the batter concerned will be charged. 41.11The protected area The protected area is defined as that area of the pitch contained within a rectangle bounded at each end by imaginary lines parallel to the popping creases and 5 ft/1.52 m in front of each, and on the sides by imaginary lines, one each side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps, each parallel to it and 1 ft/30.48 cm from it. 41.12Fielder damaging the pitch 41.12.1 It is unfair to cause deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch.

Additionally the umpire shall - inform the fielding captain of the reason for this action. - inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. The umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the fielder concerned. 41.13Bowler running on protected area 41.13.1 It is unfair for a bowler to enter the protected area in his follow-through without reasonable cause, whether or not the ball is delivered. 41.13.2 If a bowler contravenes this clause, at the first instance and when the ball is dead, the umpire shall - caution the bowler and inform the other umpire of what has occurred. This caution shall apply to that bowler throughout the innings. - inform the captain of the fielding side and the batters of what has occurred. 41.13.3 If, in that innings, the same bowler again contravenes this clause, the umpire shall repeat the above procedure indicating that this is a final warning. This warning shall also apply throughout the innings. 41.13.4 If, in that innings, the same bowler contravenes this clause a third time, when the ball is dead, the umpire shall, - direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling. If applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. The bowler taken off shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. - inform the other umpire of the reason for this action. - inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred.

If the striker enters the protected area in playing or playing at the ball, he must move from it immediately thereafter. A batter will be deemed to be causing avoidable damage if either umpire considers that his presence on the pitch is without reasonable cause. 41.14.2 If either batter causes deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch, other than as in clause 41.15, at the first instance the umpire seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the occurrence.

The umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the batter concerned. 41.15Striker in protected area 41.15.1 The striker shall not adopt a batting position in the protected area or so close to it that frequent encroachment is inevitable. The striker may make a mark on the pitch for the purpose of indicating his/her batting position provided that no mark is unreasonably close to the protected area. 41.15.2 If either umpire considers that the striker is in breach of any of the conditions in clause 41.15.1, if the bowler has not entered the delivery stride, he/she shall immediately call Dead ball, otherwise, wait until the ball is dead; he/she shall then inform the other umpire of the occurrence. The bowler’s end umpire shall then - warn the striker that the practice is unfair and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall apply throughout the innings. The umpire shall so inform the non-striker and each incoming batter. - inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. 41.15.3 If there is any further breach of any of the conditions in clause 41.15.1 by any batter in that innings, the umpire seeing the contravention shall, if the bowler has not entered his delivery stride, immediately call and signal Dead ball, otherwise, he/she shall wait until the ball is dead and then inform the other umpire of the occurrence.

Unless the bowler attempts to run out the non-striker – see clause 38.3 (Non-striker leaving his/her ground early) – the umpire shall - call and signal Dead ball as soon as the batters cross in such an attempt. - inform the other umpire of the reason for this action. The bowler’s end umpire shall then - return the batters to their original ends and disallow the attempted run. - award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. - award any other 5 run Penalty that is applicable - inform the batters, the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side, of the reason for this action.

Note, however, that the restrictions on awarding Penalty runs, in clauses 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded), 34.4 (Runs scored from ball lawfully struck more than once) and 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side), will apply. 41.17.3 When 5 Penalty runs are awarded to the batting side under any of clauses 24.4 (Player returning without permission), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side) or under 41.3, 41.4, 41.5, 41.9 or 41.12, then - they shall be scored as Penalty extras and shall be in addition to any other penalties. - they are awarded when the ball is dead and shall not be regarded as runs scored from either the immediately preceding delivery or the immediately following delivery, and shall be in addition to any runs from those deliveries. - the batters shall not change ends solely by reason of the 5 run penalty. 41.17.4 When 5 Penalty runs are awarded to the fielding side, under clause 18.5.2 (Deliberate short runs), or under 41.10, 41.14, 41.15 or 41.16, they shall be added as Penalty extras to that side’s total of runs in its most recently completed innings. If the fielding side has not completed an innings, the 5 Penalty runs shall be added to the score in its next innings. 42 PLAYERS’ CONDUCT 42.1 Serious misconduct 42.1.1 The umpires shall act upon any serious misconduct. The relevant offences and the corresponding actions by the umpires are identified in clause 42.2.1. These offences correspond with Level 4 offences in the ICC Code of Conduct.

This call may be delayed until the umpire is satisfied that it will not disadvantage the non-offending side. 42.1.3 The umpire concerned shall report the matter to the other umpire and together they shall decide whether an offence has been committed. The umpires may also consult with the third umpire and the match referee, who may review any audio or video replays to confirm whether an offence has been committed. If so, the umpires shall then apply the related sanctions. 42.1.4 Any call of No ball or Wide before the offence shall stand 42.1.5 If the offence is committed by a batter, the umpires shall summon the offending player’s captain to the field. Solely for the purpose of this clause, the batters at the wicket may not deputise for their captain. 42.2 Level 4 offences and action by umpires 42.2.1 Any of the following actions by a player shall constitute a Level 4 offence: - threatening to assault an umpire - making inappropriate and deliberate physical contact with an umpire - physically assaulting a player or any other person - committing any other act of violence. 42.2.2 If such an offence is committed, 42.2.2.1 to 42.2.2.5 shall be implemented. 42.2.2.1 The umpire shall call Time. 42.2.2.2 Together the umpires shall summon and inform the offending player’s captain that an offence at this Level has occurred. 42.2.2.3 The umpires shall instruct the captain to remove the offending player immediately from the field of play for the remainder of the match and shall apply the following: 42.2.2.3.1 If the offending player is a fielder, no substitute shall be allowed for him.

A fielder’s equipment is any external protective equipment that he is wearing. 2.5 The bat – the following are to be considered as part of the bat: - the whole of the bat itself. - the whole of a glove (or gloves) worn on the hand (or hands) holding the bat. - the hand (or hands) holding the bat, if the batter is not wearing a glove on that hand or on those hands. 2.6 Held in batter’s hand. Contact between a batter’s hand, or glove worn on his hand, and any part of the bat shall constitute the bat being held in that hand. 3 The playing area 3.1 The field of play is the area contained within the boundary. 3.2 The square is a specially prepared area of the field of play within which the match pitch is situated. 3.3 The outfield is that part of the field of play between the square and the boundary. 4 Positioning 4.1 Behind the popping crease at one end of the pitch is that area of the field of play, including any other marking, objects and persons therein, that is on that side of the popping crease that does not include the creases at the opposite end of the pitch. Behind, in relation to any other marking, object or person, follows the same principle. See the diagram in paragraph 13. 4.2 In front of the popping crease at one end of the pitch is that area of the field of play, including any other marking, objects and persons therein, that is on that side of the popping crease that includes the creases at the opposite end of the pitch. In front of, in relation to any other marking, object or person, follows the same principle. See the diagram in paragraph 13. 4.3 The striker’s end is the place where the striker stands to receive a delivery from the bowler only insofar as it identifies, independently of where the striker may subsequently move, one end of the pitch. 4.4 The bowler’s end is the end from which the bowler delivers the ball. It is the other end of the pitch from the striker’s end and identifies that end of the pitch that is not the striker’s end as described in paragraph 4.3. 4.5 The wicket-keeper’s end is the same as the striker’s end as described in paragraph 4.3. 4.6 In front of the line of the striker’s wicket is in the area of the field of play in front of the imaginary line joining the fronts of the stumps at the striker’s end; 69 this line to be considered extended in both directions to the boundary. See paragraph 4.2. 4.7 Behind the wicket is in the area of the field of play behind the imaginary line joining the backs of the stumps at the appropriate end; this line to be considered extended in both directions to the boundary. See paragraph 4.1. 4.8 Behind the wicket-keeper is behind the wicket at the striker’s end, as defined above, but in line with both sets of stumps and further from the stumps than the wicket-keeper. 4.9 Off side/on (leg) side – see diagram in paragraph 13 4.10 Inside edge is the edge on the same side as the nearer wicket. 5 Umpires and decision-making 5.1 Umpire – where the description the umpire is used on its own, it always means ‘the bowler’s end umpire’ though this full description is sometimes used for emphasis or clarity. Similarly the umpires always means both umpires and the third umpire. An umpire and umpires are generalised terms. Otherwise, a fuller description indicates which one of the umpires is specifically intended. Each umpire will be bowler’s end umpire and striker’s end umpire in alternate overs. 5.2 Bowler’s end umpire is the umpire who is standing at the bowler’s end (see paragraph 4.4) for the current delivery. 5.3 Striker’s end umpire is the umpire who is standing at the striker’s end (see paragraph 4.3), to one side of the pitch or the other, depending on his/her choice, for the current delivery. 5.4 On-field umpires shall mean, collectively, the bowler’s end umpire and the striker’s end umpire. 5.5 Third umpire is the umpire who may use television evidence and other available technology in order review a decision of the on-field umpires, either by way of an Umpire Review or a Player Review under the protocol set out in Appendix D. The third umpire shall also determine No balls under clause 21.5 (Fair delivery – the feet). 5.6 Umpires together agree applies to decisions which the umpires are to make jointly, independently of the players. 5.7 Decision Review System or DRS is the process covered by the Decision Review System and Third Umpire Protocol set out in Appendix D, under which the third umpire may be consulted in relation to a decision of the on-field umpires, either by way of an Umpire Review or a Player Review. 5.8 Player Review is the process set out in Appendix D by which a player may request a review of any decision taken by the on-field umpires concerning whether or not a batter is dismissed (with the exception of ‘Timed out’). 5.9 Umpire Review is the process set out in Appendix D by which an on-field umpire has the discretion to refer a decision to the third umpire or, under certain circumstances, to consult with the third umpire before making a decision. 5.10 Soft Signal is the visual communication by the bowler’s end umpire to the third umpire (accompanied by additional information via two-way radio where necessary) of his/her initial on-field decision prior to initiating an Umpire Review. 70 5.11 Umpire’s Call is the concept within the DRS under which the on-field decision of the bowler’s end umpire shall stand, which shall apply under the specific circumstances set out in paragraphs Error! Reference source not found. a nd Error! Reference source not found. of Appendix D, where the balltracking technology indicates a marginal decision in respect of either the Impact Zone or the Wicket Zone. 5.12 The Pitching Zone as used in the DRS is a two dimensional area on the pitch between both sets of stumps with its boundaries consisting of the base of both sets of stumps and a line between the outside of the outer stumps at each end. 5.13 The Impact Zone as used in the DRS is a three dimensional space extending between both sets of stumps to an indefinite height vertically and with its boundaries consisting of the base of the stumps and the outside of the outer stumps at each end. 5.14 The Wicket Zone as used in the DRS is a two dimensional area with its boundaries consisting of the outside of the outer stumps, the base of the stumps, and the top of the stumps. 5.15 A Fair Catch is a catch that has been taken cleanly by the fielder in accordance with clause 33. 5.16 A Bump Ball is where the ball has made contact with the ground shortly after making contact with the striker’s bat. 6 Batters 6.1 Batting side is the side currently batting, whether or not play is in progress. 6.2 Member of the batting side is one of the players nominated by the captain of the batting side, or any authorised replacement for such nominated player. 6.3 The Striker is the batter who receives the ball delivered by the bowler. 6.4 The non-striker is the batter who ground is at the bowler’s end when the ball is delivered. 6.5 A batter’s ground – at each end of the pitch, the whole area of the field of play behind the popping crease is the ground at that end for a batter. 6.6 Original end is the end where a batter was when the ball came into play for that delivery. 6.7 Wicket he has left is the wicket at the end where a batter was at the start of the run in progress. 6.8 A batting position is the position and posture adopted by the striker to receive a ball delivered by the bowler 6.9 For the purposes of these Playing Conditions, waist height is defined as the point at which the top of the batter’s trousers would conventionally be when he is standing upright at the popping crease. 7 Fielders 7.1 Fielding side is the side currently fielding, whether or not play is in progress. 7.2 Member of the fielding side is one of the players nominated by the captain of the fielding side, or any authorised replacement or substitute for such nominated player. 71 7.3 Fielder is one of the 11 or fewer players who together represent the fielding side on the field of play. This definition includes not only both the bowler and the wicket-keeper but also nominated players who are legitimately on the field of play, together with players legitimately acting as substitutes for absent nominated players. It excludes any nominated player who is absent from the field of play, or who has been absent from the field of play and who has not yet obtained the umpire’s permission to return. A player going briefly outside the boundary in the course of discharging his duties as a fielder is not absent from the field of play nor, for the purposes of clause 24.2 (Fielder absent or leaving the field of play), is he to be regarded as having left the field of play. 8 Substitutes and Concussion Replacements 8.1 A Substitute is a player who takes the place of a fielder on the field of play, but does not replace the player for whom he substitutes on that side’s list of nominated players. A substitute’s activities are limited to fielding. 8.2 A Concussion Replacement is a player who takes the place of a player who has been replaced in accordance with the process set out in clause 1.2.7, and who for the remainder of the match replaces that player on that side’s list of nominated players, being able to take a full part in the match (subject to such restrictions as may be imposed by the ICC Match Referee in accordance with clause 1.2.7.4) 8.3 A Concussion Replacement Request is the notification made to the ICC Match Referee in accordance with the process set out in clause 1.2.7.3 8.4 The Team Medical Representative is the individual designated as having responsibility for the assessment of any head or neck injury sustained by a player as set out in clause 1.2.7.2 9 Bowlers 9.1 Over the wicket / round the wicket – if, as the bowler runs up between the wicket and the return crease, the wicket is on the same side as his bowling arm, he is bowling over the wicket. If the return crease is on the same side as his bowling arm, he is bowling round the wicket. 9.2 Delivery swing is the motion of the bowler’s arm during which he normally releases the ball for a delivery. 9.3 Delivery stride is the stride during which the delivery swing is made, whether the ball is released or not. It starts when the bowler’s back foot lands for that stride and ends when the front foot lands in the same stride. The stride after the delivery stride is completed when the next foot lands, i.e. when the back foot of the delivery stride lands again. 9.4 The Illegal Bowling Regulations are the ICC’s regulations governing Illegal Bowling Actions. 9.5 An Illegal Bowling Action is a bowling action where a bowler’s Elbow Extension exceeds 15 degrees, measured from the point at which the bowling arm reaches the horizontal until the point at which the ball is released (any Elbow Hyperextension shall be discounted for the purposes of determining an Illegal Bowling Action). 9.6 Elbow Extension means the motion that occurs when a bowler\\'s arm moves from a flexed (bent) position at the elbow, to a more extended (straight) position (full Elbow Extension occurs when the arm is straight). 72 9.7 Elbow Hyperextension is the motion that occurs when a bowler\\'s elbow extends beyond the straight position. 9.8 The ICC Bowling Action Report Form is the form provided for by Article 3 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations, by which an umpire and/or the ICC Match Referee may submit a report relating to a suspected Illegal Bowling Action. 10 The ball 10.1 The ball is struck/strikes the ball unless specifically defined otherwise, mean ‘the ball is struck by the bat’/‘strikes the ball with the bat’. 10.2 Full-pitch describes a ball delivered by the bowler that reaches or passes the striker without having touched the ground. Sometimes described as nonpitching. 11 Runs 11.1 A run to be disallowed is one that in these Playing Conditions should not have been taken. It is not only to be cancelled but the batters are to be returned to their original ends. 11.2 A run not to be scored is one that is not illegal, but is not recognised as a properly executed run. It is not a run that has been made, so the question of cancellation does not arise. The loss of the run so attempted is not a disallowance and the batters will not be returned to their original ends on that account. 12 The person 12.1 Person; A player’s person is his physical person (flesh and blood) together with any clothing or legitimate external protective equipment that he is wearing except, in the case of a batter, his bat. A hand, whether gloved or not, that is not holding the bat is part of the batter’s person. No item of clothing or equipment is part of the player’s person unless it is attached to him. For a batter, a glove being held but not worn is part of his person. For a fielder, an item of clothing or equipment he is holding in his hand or hands is not part of his person. 12.2 Clothing – anything that a player is wearing, including such items as spectacles or jewellery, that is not classed as external protective equipment is classed as clothing, even though he may be wearing some items of apparel, which are not visible, for protection. A bat being carried by a batter does not come within this definition of clothing. 12.3 Hand for batter or wicket-keeper shall include both the hand itself and the whole of a glove worn on the hand. 73 13 Off side / on side; in front of / behind the popping crease. 74 Appendix B Equipment 1 The Bat 1.1 General guidance 1.1.1 Measurements - All provisions in paragraphs 1.2 to 1.6 below are subject to the measurements and restrictions stated in the Playing Conditions and this Appendix. 1.1.2 Adhesives – Throughout, adhesives are permitted only where essential and only in minimal quantity. 1.2 Specifications for the Handle 1.2.1 One end of the handle is inserted into a recess in the blade as a means of joining the handle and the blade.

See also paragraph 2.3.4 below. 2.1.4 Additionally, if on review of a run out, bowled or hit wicket, the third umpire finds the batter is Out by another mode of dismissal (excluding LBW), or Not out by any mode of dismissal (excluding LBW), he/she shall notify the on-field umpire so that the correct decision is made. 2.1.5 If the third umpire decides that the batter is Out, a red light shall be displayed; if the third umpire decides that the batter is Not out, a green light shall be displayed. Should the third umpire be temporarily unable to respond, a white light (where available) shall remain illuminated throughout the period of interruption to signify to the on-field umpires that Umpire Reviews are temporarily unavailable, in which case the decision shall be taken by the on-field umpire. As an alternative to the red/green light system, the replay screen (where available) may be used for the purpose of conveying the third umpire’s decision, in line with the ICC Big Screen Policy. 2.2 Caught Decisions, Obstructing the Field 2.2.1 Where the bowler’s end umpire is unable to decide upon a Fair Catch or a Bump Ball, or if, on appeal from the fielding side, the batter obstructed the field, he/she shall first consult with the striker’s end umpire. 2.2.2 Should both on-field umpires require assistance from the third umpire to make a decision, the bowler’s end umpire shall consult by two-way radio with the third umpire followed by making the shape of a TV screen with his/her hands. 2.2.3 The third umpire shall determine whether the batter has been caught, whether the delivery was a Bump Ball, or if the batter obstructed the field. However, in reviewing the television replay(s), the third umpire shall first check the fairness of the delivery in relation to the front foot and the bowler using an Illegal Bowling Action, subject to the proviso that the third umpire may review whether the bowler has used a prohibited Specific Variation under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations) and whether the batter has hit the ball. If the delivery was not a fair delivery he/she shall advise the bowler’s end umpire to signal No ball. See also paragraph 2.6 below.

Communication with the third umpire shall be by two-way radio. 2.6.2 The third umpire shall check any mode of No ball on request not already checked except for the bowler using an Illegal Bowling Action (subject to the proviso that the third umpire may review whether the bowler has used a prohibited Specific Variation under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations). 2.6.3 If the delivery was not a fair delivery, the bowler’s end umpire shall indicate that the batter is Not out and signal No ball (except in the case of a dismissal for obstructing the field, which may still be effected despite a No ball being called, in which case the bowler’s end umpire shall indicate that the relevant batter is Out and additionally call a No ball). 2.6.4 If a No ball under clause 21.5, after being reviewed by the third umpire, is only called by the bowler’s end umpire after the ball is dead, the batting side shall benefit from the reversal of the dismissal and the one run for the No ball, but shall not benefit from any runs that may subsequently have accrued from the delivery 84 had the on-field umpire originally called a No ball prior to the ball becoming dead. Where the batters crossed while the ball was in the air before being caught, the batters shall return to their original ends as if the striker had been dismissed, but no runs shall be credited to the striker even if one (or more) runs were completed prior to the catch being taken. 2.7 Cameras On or Over the Field of Play 2.7.1 The on-field umpires shall be entitled to refer to the third umpire for a decision as to whether the ball has at any time during the normal course of play come into contact with any part of the camera, its apparatus or its cables above the playing area, as contemplated in clause 20.1.3. 2.7.2 Where an on-field umpire wishes to use the assistance of the third umpire in this circumstance, he/she shall communicate with the third umpire by use of a two-way radio and the third umpire shall convey his/her decision to the bowler’s end umpire by the same method. 2.7.3 A decision shall be made immediately and cannot be changed thereafter. If the television evidence is inconclusive as to whether or not the ball has come into contact with any part of the camera, its apparatus or its cables above the playing area, the default presumption shall be in favour of no contact having been made. 2.7.4 The third umpire may initiate contact with the on-field umpire by two-way radio if TV coverage shows the ball to have been in contact with any part of the camera or its cables above the playing area as envisaged under this paragraph. 3 Interpretation of Playing Conditions 3.1 When using a replay to determine the moment at which the wicket has been put down (as per clause 29.1), the third umpire shall deem this to be the first frame in which one of the bails is shown (or can be deduced) to have lost all contact with the top of the stumps and subsequent frames show the bail permanently removed from the top of the stumps. 85 Appendix E Calculations Table 1: Calculation sheet for use when a delay or interruptions occur in the First Innings Time Net playing time available at start of the match 420 minutes (A) Time innings in progress ___________ (B) Playing time lost ___________ (C) Extra time available ___________ (D) Time made up from reduced interval ___________ (E) Effective playing time lost [C – (D + E)] ___________ (F) Remaining playing time available (A - F) ___________ (G) G divided by 4.2 (to 2 decimal places) ___________ (H) Max overs per team [H/2] (round up fractions) ___________ (I) Maximum overs per bowler [I / 5] ___________ Duration of 1 st, 2nd and 3rd Powerplay Overs ____ + ____ +____ Rescheduled Playing Hours First session to commence or recommence ___________ (J) Length of innings [I x 4.2] (round up fractions) ___________ (K) Rescheduled first innings cessation time [J + (K – B)] ___________ (L) Length of interval ___________ (M) Second innings commencement time [L + M] ___________ (N) Rescheduled second innings cessation time [N + K] ___________ *(O) * Ensure that the match is not finishing earlier than the original or rescheduled cessation time by applying clause 13.7.2.

Appendix G Super Over Procedure The following procedure shall apply where the Playing Conditions provide for a Super Over to determine the winner of a tied match. Other than where expressly stated in this Appendix (or by necessary implication), all relevant Playing Conditions for the match shall apply to the Super Over. 1. A Super Over involves each team facing an over of six balls (unless ended earlier as provided for in paragraph 2), and the winner shall be the team scoring the greater number of runs, irrespective of the number of wickets lost. 2. The loss of two wickets shall end the batting team’s one over innings. 3. If the Super Over is a tie, subsequent Super Overs shall be played until a winner is determined. Other than in exceptional circumstances (as set out in paragraph 25 below), an unlimited number of Super Overs may be played where necessary to determine a result. 4. Subject to weather conditions, the Super Over shall take place on the scheduled day of the match at a time to be determined by the ICC Match Referee. In normal circumstances it shall commence 5 minutes after the conclusion of the match. 5. The Super Over shall be played until completion, but if there are any delays or interruptions during the Super Over, extra time (taken from the start of the first Super Over) is allocated to complete the Super Over or any subsequent Super Overs. The amount of extra time allocated to the Super Over is the greater of; a) the gap between the time at which the match ended and the time the original match would have been scheduled to finish had the entire extra time provision been utilized, or b) 20 minutes. 6. Should play be delayed prior to or during the Super Over(s) once the playing time lost exceeds the extra time allocated, the Super Over(s) shall be abandoned (see paragraph 24 below). 7. The Super Over shall take place on the pitch allocated for the match, unless otherwise determined by the umpires in consultation with the Ground Authority and the ICC Match Referee. 8. Only nominated players in the match (including Concussion Replacements) may participate in the Super Over. 9. Any penalty time being served in the match shall be carried forward to the Super Over. 10. The umpires shall stand at the same end at which they finished the match. 11. The team batting second in the match shall bat first in the Super Over. 12. Each Team shall be allowed one unsuccessful player review per innings per Super Over. This entitlement shall apply irrespective of the number of unsuccessful Player Review requests made during the match itself. 13. The captain of the fielding team (or his nominee) shall select the ball with which the fielding team shall bowl its over in the Super Over from the box of spare balls provided by the umpires (which shall include the balls used in the match, but no new balls). The team fielding second may then choose to use the same ball as 89 chosen by the team bowling first or choose another ball from the same box. If the ball needs to be changed, the relevant Playing Conditions as they apply in the match shall also apply in the Super Over. 14. The fielding side shall choose the end from which it is to bowl its one over. 15. The Super Over shall be played with the same fielding restrictions as would be applicable for the last over in an uninterrupted match. 16. The interval between the two overs in the Super Over shall be 5 minutes. TIED SUPER OVER – REPEATING THE SUPER OVER 17. If the Super Over is tied, then subsequent Super Overs shall be played until there is a winner (subject to paragraph 25). 18. In normal circumstances any subsequent Super Over shall start 5 minutes after the previous Super Over ends. 19. The team batting second in the previous Super Over shall bat first in the subsequent Super Over. 20. The balls selected for use by each team in the previous Super Over shall be used again by the same team in any subsequent Super Over(s). 21. The fielding side shall bowl its over in a subsequent Super Over from the opposite end from which it bowled in the previous Super Over. 22. Any batter dismissed in any previous Super Over shall be ineligible to bat in any subsequent Super Over. 23. Any bowler who bowled in the previous Super Over shall be ineligible to bowl in the subsequent Super Over. 24. In all other ways the procedure for a subsequent Super Over shall be the same as for the initial Super Over. SUPER OVER UNABLE TO BE COMPLETED 25. Where the Super Over or subsequent Super Overs are abandoned for any reason prior to completion then the match shall be declared a tie and points allocated as in Clause 16.11.1. 26. In circumstances where there are unavoidable time constraints (for example, a requirement to switch off floodlights at a certain time) which do not allow the completion of multiple Super Overs, the ICC Match Referee may limit the number of possible Super Overs and shall advise both captains accordingly prior to the start of the first Super Over. EXAMPLES - EXTRA TIME AVAILABLE FOR THE SUPER OVER Example 1: The match is scheduled to finish at 10.20pm, with 60 minutes of extra time available to be used. The scheduled cut-off time if all the available extra time is used would be 11.20pm. The match runs over time and finishes in a tie at 10.35pm. The Super Over is scheduled to start 5 minutes later at 10.40pm. The extra time available to complete the Super Over would be 45 minutes (as per paragraph 5(a) above). • The Super Over starts on time but is interrupted at 10.50pm for 10 minutes (leaving 35 minutes of extra time still available). • Play resumes at 11.00pm with a tied Super Over occurring. • The second super over is being played but is interrupted at 11.15pm. 90 • Play does not resume within 35 minutes (being the amount of extra time still available), therefore the Super Over procedure is abandoned, and the match is a tie. Example 2: The same match is scheduled to finish at 10.20pm, but with 30 minutes of extra time available to be used. The scheduled cut-off time if all the available extra time is used would be 10.50pm. The match runs over time and finishes in a tie at 10.35pm. The Super Over is scheduled to start 5 minutes later at 10.40pm. The extra time available to complete the Super Over would be 20 minutes (as per paragraph 5(b) above). Appendix H On Field Injury Assessments and Treatment The umpires will allow an initial 4 minutes for medical staff to treat the injured player. Umpires may inform the medical team when there is 90 seconds remaining, after which, the player should be removed from the field of play if further assessment/treatment is required. The on-field umpires will consider each incident when applying the 4-minute guideline and be guided by the appointed Match Day Doctor or his/her nominated replacement.

These rules apply to all ECB competitions together with other \\\\nCounty Age Group matches within the age groups U9 to U18. \\\\n1.2 The ECB and relevant Sub-Committee may delegate any of their powers and \\\\nduties. \\\\n \\\\n2 Entry \\\\n2.1 Entry into any of ECB’s County Competitions shall be open to those County \\\\nBoards recognised by the ECB. \\\\n2.2 Counties who participated in the previous year’s Competition shall \\\\nautomatically be included for the following season unless writ ten notification \\\\nto the contrary is given by 1st September in the year prior to the Competition. \\\\nA County wishing to enter or be re -admitted to a Competition must give \\\\nwritten notice to that effect to the ECB Competitions Team by 1st September \\\\nin the year prior to the Competition. \\\\n2.3 It shall be a condition of entry that the Club is a bona-fide cricket club, affiliated \\\\nto their local County Board, having a recognised home and away weekend \\\\nfixture list and playing on a home ground of suitable standard.  \\\\nClubs must play their home matches on the main square of their home ground \\\\nunless prior permission has been obtained from the ECB Competitions Team \\\\nto move the fixture to an alternative ground.  If such permission is not given \\\\nECB will order the match to  be played on the opponent’s ground. Should the \\\\numpires report a pitch as being unfit, the ECB shall have the option of ordering \\\\nthe match to be replayed on the opponent’s ground, if time permits, or of \\\\nawarding the match to the opposition. \\\\nUnder these rules County Cricket Academies are ineligible to play in ECB club \\\\ncompetitions. If a Club fails to fulfil their administrative responsibilities or any \\\\nfixture in the competition, other than due to bad weather, they will be banned \\\\nfrom entering the competition for the following season. \\\\n \\\\n3 Qualification of Players \\\\n3.1 Regulations Governing the Qualification of Cricketers for England  \\\\nTo see regulations relating to Qualification of Cricketers for England, please go \\\\nto ecb.co.uk. \\\\n3.2 Regulations governing the Qualification of Cricketers for Competitive County \\\\nCricket  \\\\n To see regulations relating to Qualification of Cricketers for Competition \\\\nCounty Cricket, please go to ecb.co.uk. \\\\n \\\\n3.3 Definitions \\\\n3.3.1 Competitive County Cricket refers to matches played in the course of: \\\\n(a) The County Championship \\\\n(b) The Metro Bank One Day Cup and Vitality T20 Blast \\\\n(c) The Hundred \\\\n(d) Any other similar competition authorised by and designated as \\\\nCompetitive County Cricket by the ECB. \\\\n3.3.2 Qualification to play for England refers to matches played in the course \\\\nof: \\\\n(a) The National Counties Championship. \\\\n3.3.3 England and Wales means England, Wales, the Channel Islands and the \\\\nIsle of Man. \\\\n3.3.4 The EEA means the European Economic Area and includes each of its \\\\nmember states as from time to  time applicable. Currently the EEA \\\\ncomprises the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \\\\nthe Republic of Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, \\\\nFrance, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Austria, \\\\nFinland, Sweden, Norway, Liechtenstein, Iceland, Cyprus (Greek part), \\\\nCzech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, \\\\nSlovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania and includes each of its \\\\nmember states as from time to time applicable. \\\\n3.3.5 Residing and resident  mean the occupation of a bona fide home (i.e. \\\\nthe only or main home of the Cricketer concerned) and the acquisition \\\\nof temporary accommodation during the season may not fulfil this \\\\nrequirement. \\\\n3.3.6 Full Member Country means a country which is a full mem ber of the \\\\nInternational Cricket Council. \\\\n \\\\n3.4 Qualification Criteria for Junior Cricketers (Open (Boys) and Girls) \\\\nPlease note that playing restrictions included in any Visa that an individual \\\\nholds will supersede any of the qualification regulations listed below. \\\\nThe qualification criteria for all County Representative cricket for the Under 18 \\\\nage group and below is as follows: \\\\n3.4.1 A player may only represent one County in any one Competition in any \\\\none season, with the exception of those players that are dual registered \\\\nwith another County  (see separate information relating to dual \\\\nregistration, can be obtained by contacting competitions@ecb.co.uk). \\\\n3.4.2 A player shall be eligible to play for a County provided: \\\\ni) The player is permanently reside nt within, or was born within, that \\\\nCounty. \\\\nii)  Alternatively, the player is attending an educational establishment \\\\nwithin that County (this does not include international exchange \\\\nstudents who remain ineligible). \\\\niii) Alternatively, the player has been a bona-fide playing member of a club \\\\nwithin that County for at least the entire preceding season including \\\\nplaying in representative matches for that club. \\\\n3.4.3 County boundaries shall be as defined by ECB Cricketing County \\\\nBoundaries as currently agreed. \\\\n3.4.4 A player may play for a County for whom the player is not qualified only \\\\nif the player has not been selected by the County/Counties for whom \\\\nthe player is otherwise qualified and has obtained the written consent \\\\nof that County/those Counties. Such consent shall not be unreasonably \\\\nwithheld. There is no requirement to obtain the consent of the County \\\\nof birth. In the event of a dispute the matter shall be referred to the \\\\nECB, whose decision shall be final. \\\\n3.4.5 A player who has played for a County, with a valid qualification for that \\\\nCounty, during a season can continue to play for that County, if \\\\nselected, the following season even if the player no longer has a current \\\\nqualification (for example following a change of school).  \\\\nThe qualification remains valid from season to season, but lapses if the \\\\nplayer does not represent the County during a season. \\\\n3.4.6 Age groups are defined by the player’s age at midnight on 31st August \\\\nin the year prior to the relevant season. \\\\n \\\\n3.5 Points of Clarification \\\\nThe following points are intended to answer some of the more frequently \\\\nasked questions relating to the qualification criteria: \\\\n3.5.1 The \"entire preceding season\" membership requirement means that \\\\nclub membership during the current season does not count and players \\\\nmust have become a bona fide member of the club no later than 1st \\\\nMay during the preceding season. \\\\n3.5.2 Playing membership of a club includes membership of a soft ball cricket \\\\nor ‘Junior Colts’ section if the club has one, and includes  match play \\\\nagainst other clubs. \\\\n3.5.3 Qualification by birth is excluded from the ‘consent’ arrangements for \\\\nthe sake of simplicity. \\\\n3.5.4 Players who have multiple qualifications are free to select the County \\\\nthat they wish to represent. Once that select ion is made it remains in \\\\nforce for that season, but can be changed in subsequent seasons, \\\\nwithout requiring consent, provided that the player still has a valid \\\\nqualification for the newly selected County and notifies the player’s \\\\nformer County in writing. \\\\n3.5.5 A player who is registered or contracted to a First Class County (FCC) is \\\\neligible to play for the appropriate age group sides of that County. FCC’s \\\\nwishing to register and contract a player not otherwise qualified for \\\\nthat County should seek the co nsent of the other County/Counties \\\\ninvolved. Such consent should not be unreasonably withheld. \\\\nRegistering or contracting a player does not override the restriction on \\\\nplaying for only one County in any one Competition in a season, so that \\\\nif a player has played, as an example, for a Non First Class County’s \\\\nUnder 18 side and subsequently signs for a FCC he cannot play in the \\\\nFCC’s Under 18 team that season but could play for their Under 19 \\\\nteam if they run one. \\\\n \\\\n3.5.6 It is generally accepted that Academy Directors should have \\\\nresponsibility for the cricketers in their charge, where they play and up \\\\nto a point when they bowled and where they batted. Players joining a \\\\nFirst Class Academy would not automatically qualify for that County. \\\\nThe Academy Director should draw up and agree a playing programme \\\\nto meet the needs of the player, which might involve a player  \\\\ncontinuing to play for his National County or might mean a transfer to \\\\nthe First Class County (as already allowed in the case of contracted \\\\nplayers) or a combination of both.  \\\\nThe existing regulations preventing a player from playing for more than \\\\none County in a specific Competition during the season remain in force. \\\\nIt was agreed that good communication between Counties, based on \\\\nthe best interests of the player, was the key.  \\\\n3.5.7 Club membership during the preceding season will qualify a player to \\\\nplay only for the County in which the club is physically located (as per \\\\nthe ECB Cricketing County Boundaries as currently defined). \\\\nMembership of a League that crosses County boundaries, affiliation to \\\\nmore than one County Board or participation in the Colts structure of \\\\nanother County will not alter the primary affiliation of the club to the \\\\nCounty in which it is located and therefore the County qualifica tion \\\\nbased on club membership of its players. \\\\nAll disputes relating to these qualification criteria should be addressed \\\\nto the ECB Competitions Team. \\\\n \\\\n3.6 ECB Club Cup Competitions Eligibility Rules  \\\\nFor the purposes of this Rule 3.6, an “ECB Club Cup Competition” shall mean \\\\neach of the club competitions known, for the purposes of the 2023 season, as \\\\nthe ECB National Club Championship, the Vitality Club T20 and the ECB Indoor \\\\nNational Club Championship. \\\\n3.6.1 A cricketer shall only be eligible to play for a club in an ECB Club Cup \\\\nCompetition if the club is a member of an ECB -recognised league (a \\\\n“League”) and the cricketer is a bona-fide, fully paid-up member of that \\\\nclub who is also eligible to play f or that club under the rules of that \\\\nLeague. \\\\n3.6.2 A cricketer shall only be eligible to play in an ECB Club Cup Competition \\\\nfor one club in any one season.  \\\\n3.6.3 A cricketer who is registered for an ECB Premier League club shall only \\\\nbe eligible to play for that club in any ECB Club Cup Competition match. \\\\n3.6.4 A club shall be subject to the following rules regarding cricketers who \\\\nare registered and contracted to a First Class County Club (a “FCC \\\\nCricketer”) in respect of any given ECB Club Cup Competition match:  \\\\n3.6.4.1 It may play any FCC Cricketer who is both under the age of 21 \\\\nas at 30 September in the calendar year preceding the season \\\\nin question and has not played for their FCC during the current \\\\nseason in any of the County Championship, One-Day Cup or T20 \\\\nBlast; and  \\\\n3.6.4.2 It may play no more than one other FCC Cricketer provided that \\\\nthe FCC Cricketer in question has played i) at least two League \\\\nmatches for that club during the current season or ii) has played \\\\nat least two League matches during the immediate pr evious \\\\nseason in the event that the ECB Club Cup Competition match \\\\nin which they intend to play commences before two scheduled \\\\nleague fixture s have been played . League matches that were \\\\nabandoned without a ball being bowled do not count towards \\\\nthis required total of matches played.  \\\\n3.6.4.3 A FCC Cricketer must meet either 3.6.4.1 or 3.6.4.2 for each ECB \\\\nClub Cup Competition match they play in. It is recognised that \\\\n3.6.4.2 may result in a player being eligible for an early round \\\\nmatch (based on status of played matches under 3.6.4.2 ii) and \\\\nthen not eligible for a later round match (based on status of \\\\nplayed matches under 3.6.4.2 i).  \\\\n3.6.5 Any player who has represented the men’s team of any ICC Full \\\\nMember country in the 12 month period up to and including 31 March \\\\nof the current season will not be permitted to play in any ECB Club Cup \\\\nCompetition match in the current season. \\\\n3.6.6 A club shall play no more than one Category 3 player who is registered \\\\nfor that club by their League (an “Overseas Player”) per ECB Club Cup \\\\nCompetition match.  \\\\n3.6.7 Where no club Overseas Player is available to play for that club in an \\\\nECB Club Cup Competition match , that club shall not be permitted to \\\\nregister and play a new replacement Overseas Player in that match.     \\\\n3.6.8 There shall be no limit on the number of Category 1 qualified cricketers \\\\n(3.6.8.1) which a club is permitted to play in an ECB Club Cup \\\\nCompetition match, for which purposes: \\\\n3.6.8.1 A cricketer is Category 1 qualified if: (i) they are a British citizen \\\\nand were born in England or Wales; or (ii) they have been \\\\nresident in England and Wales since 1 April 2023 for a minimum \\\\nof 210 days between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024. \\\\n3.6.8.2 Any player who has played in any overseas cricket league as a \\\\n‘home’, ‘local’ or ‘non-overseas’ player in that overseas league \\\\nin the 12 month period up to and including 31 March 2024 will \\\\nnot be permitted to play as a Category 1 player in any ECB Club \\\\nCup Competition match in the current season. \\\\n3.6.9 A cricketer that is dual registered with more than one club must have \\\\nplayed at least two league fixtures for the club before becoming eligible \\\\nto play in any ECB Club Cup Competition match. League matches that \\\\nwere abandoned without a ball being bowled do not count towards this \\\\nrequired total of matches played. \\\\n3.6.10 The relevant League and/or the ECB may, for the purposes of \\\\nestablishing compliance with this Rule 3.6, ask clubs to produce \\\\nevidence of their players’ eligibility for the purposes of the \\\\nenforcement of this Rule 3.6, including (but not limited to) through the \\\\nproduction of players’ passports, bank statements and utility bills.  \\\\n3.7 Ineligible Players \\\\nIf a player has been fielded in a match and is alleged to have been ineligible to \\\\nplay for the relevant club, in accordance with the provisions in this Rule 3 \\\\nand/or the rules of the specific Competition (where applica ble), the matter \\\\nshall be determined in accordance with this Rule 3.7.  \\\\n \\\\nAll issues regarding the eligibility of players shall be referred to a panel of three \\\\nmembers of the Committee with control of the relevant Competition (the \\\\n“Panel”), whose decision s hall be final and binding. The Panel shall consider \\\\nany such matter in such manner and following such procedures as it considers \\\\nappropriate and shall not be bound by rules governing the admissibility of \\\\nevidence in judicial or other proceedings. \\\\n \\\\nWhere a club wishes to challenge the eligibility of a player, the challenge must \\\\nbe made in writing, contain the particulars of the grounds upon which it is \\\\nmade and be received by the ECB within one week of the match to which it \\\\nrelates. The ECB shall send a copy of any challenge to the club the player was \\\\nfielded for, which shall lodge a defence to the challenge with particulars of the \\\\ndefence within 48 hours of receipt of the challenge. \\\\n \\\\nThe ECB shall confirm the identity of the Panel members to the relevant clubs. \\\\nIf either club objects to any member of the Panel on the basis of a conflict of \\\\ninterest, the ECB shall consider whether it is necessary to appoint a new \\\\nmember of the Panel.   \\\\n \\\\nThe Panel will then consider whether the player was eligible to pl ay in the \\\\nmatch. If the Panel concludes that the player was not eligible to play, the club \\\\nshall be deemed to have forfeited the match in which the player was fielded, \\\\nand shall lose any points gained in that match, and (where appropriate) the \\\\nopposing club shall advance to the next round of the Competition. \\\\n \\\\n4 Cricket Balls \\\\nThe Home side shall provide two new cricket balls for each match when balls \\\\nare not provided by the ECB.  The balls shall be of the standard laid down by \\\\nthe ECB for each Competition an d shall be given to the umpires prior to the \\\\ncommencement of the match.  \\\\nThe Home side will also be responsible for supplying enough spare balls of \\\\nequal standard. A new ball must be used at the start of each innings. \\\\n \\\\n5 Umpires \\\\n5.1 Each club side shall ap point one Member of the ECB Association of Cricket \\\\nOfficials (ECB ACO), who has received DBS clearance, in each match unless the \\\\numpires are appointed by the ECB or the County Board.

Any decision of the ECB shall \\\\nbe final and binding on the parties concerned.  \\\\nGeneric Playing Conditions \\\\n \\\\n1 Number of Overs per Bowler \\\\n1.1 Unless otherwise specified in the Playing Conditions for a specific Competition \\\\nno bowler may bowl more than one-fifth of the amount of overs scheduled for \\\\nthe innings. However, in a delayed start, or interrupted match, where the overs \\\\nare reduced for both sides, or for the side bowling second, no bowler may bowl \\\\nmore than one-fifth of the total overs allowed (unless such a number has been \\\\nexceeded before the interruption), except that where the total overs are not \\\\ndivisible by five, an additional over shall be allowed to the minimum number \\\\nof bowlers necessary to make up the balance - e.g. after 16 overs, ra in \\\\ninterrupts play and the innings is reduced to 32 overs. Both opening bowlers \\\\nhave bowled 8 overs. Two bowlers can bowl 7 overs and three bowlers can \\\\nbowl 6 overs. Bowlers 1 and 2 have already exceeded this limit. They count as \\\\nthe two bowlers who were a llowed the extra over (7 as opposed to 6) and so \\\\nany other bowlers are limited to 6 overs. \\\\n1.2 When an interruption occurs mid -over and on resumption the bowler has \\\\nexceeded the new maximum allocation, they will be allowed to finish the \\\\nincomplete over. \\\\n1.3 In the event of a bowler breaking down and being unable to complete an over, \\\\nanother bowler will bowl the remaining balls. Such part of an over will count \\\\nas a full over only in so far as each bowler’s limit is concerned. \\\\n1.4 Where possible, the number o f overs bowled by each individual bowler shall \\\\nbe indicated on the scoreboard, from the commencement of an innings. \\\\n1.5 The allocation of overs per bowler will not be reduced as a result of the \\\\ndeduction of any penalty overs. \\\\n \\\\n2 ECB Fast Bowling \\\\nThe ECB Fast Bowling Directives will apply to all matches in ECB Competitions \\\\nsubject to 2.1 below. \\\\n Age  Maximum overs Maximum overs \\\\n   per spell  per day \\\\n Up to U13 5 overs per spell 10 overs per day \\\\n U14 & U15 6 overs per spell 12 overs per day \\\\n U16 to U19 7 overs per spell 18 overs per day \\\\n \\\\nFor the purposes of these Directives a fast bowler is defined as a bowler to \\\\nwhom a wicket keeper in the same age group would in normal circumstances \\\\nstand back to take the ball. \\\\n \\\\nTeam Managers and/or Captains are responsible for providing the umpires \\\\nwith a team sheet showing the ages of any player who is aged Under 19 or \\\\nbelow before the toss for innings takes place.  \\\\n \\\\nUmpires are requested to ensure that this Playing Condition is strictly adhered \\\\nto in all circumstances. \\\\n2.1 In matches of 20 overs or less per team where the competition regulations \\\\nonly allow bowlers to bowl less than or equal to the number of overs specified \\\\nas the maximum in a spell in the Directives the provisions requiring an \\\\nequivalent n umber of overs from the same end to have elapsed before a \\\\nsubsequent spell can commence shall not apply (e.g. in any age group \\\\ncompetition where a maximum of 4 overs per bowler is allowed these may be \\\\nbowled at any time in the innings irrespective of the number of spells bowled). \\\\n \\\\n3 Junior Fielding Restrictions \\\\n3.1 No young player in the Under 15 age group or younger shall be allowed to field \\\\ncloser than 8 yards (7.3 metres) from the batsman’s position on the popping \\\\ncrease on a middle stump line, except be hind the wicket on the off side, until \\\\nthe batsman has played at the ball. A fielder shall be allowed to move into the \\\\nrestricted area to make a catch or field the ball provided that they were outside \\\\nthe area when the stroke was made. \\\\n3.2 For players in the Under 13 age group and below the distance is 11 yards (10 \\\\nmetres). \\\\n3.3 These minimum distances apply even if the player is wearing a helmet. \\\\n3.4 Should a young player in these age groups come within the restricted distance \\\\nthe umpire must stop the game immediately and instruct the fielder to move \\\\nback.  \\\\n3.5 In addition any young player in the Under 16 to Under 18 age groups, who has \\\\nnot reached the  age of 18, must wear a helmet when fielding within 8 yards \\\\n(7.3 metres) from the batsman’s position on the popping crease on a middle \\\\nstump line, except behind the wicket on the off side. Players should wear \\\\nappropriate protective equipment whenever they are fielding in a position \\\\nwhere they feel at risk. \\\\n \\\\n4 Law 15 – Declarations \\\\nUnless otherwise indicated, Law 15 will not apply in the Competition. The \\\\ncaptain of the batting side may not declare the innings closed at any time \\\\nduring the course of the match. \\\\n \\\\n5 Law 22 - Wide Ball - Judging a Wide \\\\n In addition to Law 22 the following will apply: \\\\nUmpires are instructed to apply a very strict and consistent interpretation in \\\\nregard to this Law in order to prevent negative bowling wide of the wicket. \\\\nAny offside or legside delivery which in the opinion of the umpire does not give \\\\nthe batsman a reasonable opportunity to score shall be called a wide. For \\\\nguidance purposes, in adult cricket a legside wide shall be called if a ball passes \\\\non the legside outside the pads of the batter standing or has stood at any point \\\\nafter the ball came into play for that delivery in a normal batting position. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n6 Bowl-Outs \\\\n6.1 In the event of no result being obtained by other methods and where there is \\\\nno reserve date on which to  play the game, a bowl -out (outdoors or indoors) \\\\nwill take place to achieve a result. Five players from each side will bowl two \\\\noverarm deliveries each at a wicket (conforming to Law 8) from a wicket \\\\npitched at a distance of 22 yards (or the length of pitc h applicable in the \\\\nCompetition) with, if practicable, bowling, popping and return creases marked \\\\n(conforming to Law 7).  \\\\n \\\\nThe side, which bowls down the wicket (as defined in Law 29.1.1) the most \\\\ntimes, shall be the winner. If the scores are equal, the sa me players will bowl \\\\none ball each alternately to achieve a result on a ‘sudden death’ basis. \\\\n The following shall also apply in respect of bowl-outs: \\\\n6.1.1 The same suitably acceptable ball (not a new one) will be used by both \\\\nteams. If this ball becomes wet, it may be changed subject to the \\\\numpires’ approval. \\\\n6.1.2 If a bowler bowls a No ball it will count as one of the two deliveries but \\\\nwill not count towards the score of the team. \\\\n6.1.3 If the original match has started, then the five cricketers nominated to \\\\ntake part in the bowl -out must be chosen from the eleven cricketers \\\\nand 12th man selected to play in the match. If there has been no play \\\\nin the original match (the toss has not taken place), the five cricketers \\\\nmay be selected from any of the playe rs in the squad as registered on \\\\nPlay-Cricket. \\\\n6.1.4 Each side will appoint a wicket -keeper to stand behind the wicket but \\\\nout of reach of the stumps. \\\\n \\\\n7 Net Run Rate \\\\nA team’s net run rate is calculated by deducting from the average runs per over \\\\nscored by that team, the average runs per over scored against that team. In \\\\nthe event of a team being all out in less than its full quota of overs, the \\\\ncalculation of the net run rate of both teams shall be based on the full quota \\\\nof overs to which the bat ting team would have been entitled and not the \\\\nnumber of overs in which the team was dismissed. \\\\n \\\\nOnly those matches where results are achieved will count for the purpose of \\\\nnet run rate calculations. Where a match is abandoned, but a result is achieved \\\\nunder Duckworth/Lewis, for net run rate purposes Team 1 will be accredited \\\\nwith Team 2\\\\\\'s Par Score on abandonment off the same number of overs faced \\\\nby Team 2. Where a match is concluded but with Duckworth/Lewis having \\\\nbeen applied at an earlier point in the match, Team 1 will be accredited with 1 \\\\nrun less than the final Target Score for Team 2 off the total number of overs \\\\nallocated to Team 2 to reach the target. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n8 Average Run Rate \\\\nA team’s average run rate is calculated by dividing the number of runs sco red \\\\nin its innings by the number of legitimate balls received during that innings. In \\\\nthe case of the team batting first being dismissed in less than the number of \\\\novers allocated for their innings, the calculation will be based on the number \\\\nof balls that the team was scheduled to receive and not on the number actually \\\\nreceived.  \\\\n \\\\nIn the case of the team batting second being unable to receive their allocated \\\\novers, the calculation of their average run rate will be based on the actual \\\\nnumber of legitimate d eliveries received by them during their innings. The \\\\naverage run rate can be calculated to any number of decimal positions and a \\\\ntie can only be achieved if the average run rates are identical. \\\\n \\\\n9 Boundaries \\\\nIt is recommended that, other than in exceptiona l circumstances, the size of \\\\nthe boundary, measured from the middle of the pitch being used in the match, \\\\nshall conform to the following dimensions: \\\\n  \\\\nOpen and Junior*: \\\\n    Minimum Maximum \\\\n All Adult matches 55m (60 yds) 70m (77 yds) \\\\n Under 17  50m (55 yds) 70m (77 yds) \\\\n Under 15  35m (38 yds) 65m (71 yds) \\\\n Under 13  30m (33 yds) 55m (60 yds) \\\\n \\\\n Women’s and Girls’*: \\\\n    Minimum Maximum \\\\n All Adult matches 50m (55 yds) 64m (70 yds) \\\\n Under 17  45m (50 yds) 55m (60 yds) \\\\n Under 15  35m (38 yds) 50m (55 yds) \\\\n Under 13  30m (33 yds) 45m (50 yds) \\\\n \\\\n* These dimensions are the requirements for the hosting of matches in ECB \\\\ncompetitions.  \\\\n \\\\n10 Scoreboard \\\\nIn all competition matches it shall be the responsibility of the batting side to \\\\nascertain the details of the score, wickets and overs from the scorers and to \\\\nsee that the scoreboard is brought up to date with this information at least at \\\\nthe end of every over , assuming that no official means of updating the \\\\nscoreboard is in place. \\\\n\\'}{\\'filename\\': \\'first.txt\\', \\'text\\': \\'ICC Code of Conduct\\\\nfor Match Officials and\\\\nMatch Official Support Personnel\\\\n14\\\\n14\\\\n14.1\\\\nICC Code of Conduct\\\\nfor Match Officials and\\\\nMatch Official Support Personnel\\\\n Page\\\\nArticle 1\\\\t Scope and Application\\\\t 14.2\\\\n Article 2\\\\t Code Of Conduct Offences\\\\t 14.3\\\\n Article 3 Reporting an Alleged Offence Under the Code of Conduct\\\\t 14.7\\\\n Article 4\\\\t Investigations and Notice of Charge 14.8\\\\n Article 5\\\\t The Disciplinary Procedure\\\\t 14.10\\\\n Article 6\\\\t Standard of Proof and Evidence\\\\t 14.15\\\\n Article 7\\\\t Sanctions\\\\t 14.16\\\\n Article 8 Appeals\\\\t 14.17\\\\n Article 9 Recognition of Decisions\\\\t 14.18\\\\n Article 10 Amendment and Interpretation of the Code Of Conduct\\\\t 14.18\\\\n Appendix 1 Definitions\\\\t 14.20\\\\n Appendix 2 PCT Code 14.23\\\\nICC Code OF Conduct for Match Officials\\\\nand Match Official Support Personnel\\\\n14.2\\\\n14\\\\nINTRODUCTION\\\\nThe ICC is the international federation responsible for the global governance of\\\\nthe sport of cricket and the Code of Conduct for Match Officials and Match Official\\\\nSupport Personnel (the “Code of Conduct”) is adopted and implemented as part of\\\\nthe ICC’s continuing efforts to maintain the public image, popularity and integrity\\\\nof cricket by providing: (a) an effective means to deter any Match Official or Match\\\\nOfficial Support Personnel from conducting themselves improperly on and off the\\\\n‘field-of-play’ or in a manner that is contrary to the ‘spirit of cricket’; and (b) a robust\\\\ndisciplinary procedure pursuant to which all matters of improper conduct can be\\\\ndealt with fairly, with certainty and in an expeditious manner.\\\\nUnless otherwise indicated,references to Articles and Appendices are to articles and\\\\nappendices of the Code of Conduct.Words in italicised text in the Code of Conduct\\\\nare defined terms and their definitions are set out in Appendix 1.\\\\n ARTICLE 1 - SCOPE AND APPLICATION\\\\n1.1 All Match Officials and Match Official Support Personnel are automatically\\\\nbound by and required to comply with all of the provisions of the\\\\nCode of Conduct.

it should be played not only according to the Laws  \\\\n(which are incorporated within these Playing Conditions), but also within the Spirit of Cricket.  \\\\nThe major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains, but extends to all players, match officials and, \\\\nespecially in junior cricket, teachers, coaches and parents. \\\\nRespect is central to the Spirit of Cricket. \\\\nRespect your captain, team-mates, opponents and the authority of the umpires. \\\\nPlay hard and play fair. \\\\nAccept the umpire’s decision. \\\\nCreate a positive atmosphere by your own conduct, and encourage others to do likewise. \\\\nShow self-discipline, even when things go against you. \\\\nCongratulate the opposition on their successes, and enjoy those of your own team. \\\\nThank the officials and your opposition at the end of the match, whatever the result. \\\\nCricket is an exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship and teamwork, which brings together people from \\\\ndifferent nationalities, cultures and religions, especially when played within the Spirit of Cricket. \\\\n1 THE PLAYERS \\\\n1.1 Number of players \\\\nA match is played between two sides, each of eleven players, one of whom shall be captain. \\\\n1.2 Nomination and replacement of players \\\\n1.2.1 Each captain shall nominate 11 players plus a maximum of 4 substitute fielders in writing to the ICC Match \\\\nReferee before the toss.  Other than set out in clause 1.2.7, no player (member of the playing eleven) may \\\\nbe changed after the nomination and prior to the start of play without the consent of the opposing captain. \\\\n1.2.2 Only those nominated as substitute fielders shall be entitled to act as substitute fielders during the match, \\\\nunless the ICC Match Referee, in exceptional circumstances, allows subsequent additions. \\\\n1.2.3 All those nominated including those nominated as substitute fielders, as well as any Concussion \\\\nReplacements, must be eligible to play for that particular team and by such nomination the nominees shall \\\\nwarrant that they are so eligible. \\\\n1.2.4 In addition, by their nomination, the nominees shall be deemed to have agreed to abide by all the applicable \\\\nICC Regulations pertaining to international cricket and in particular, the Clothing and Equipment \\\\nRegulations, the Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel (hereafter referred to as the \\\\nICC Code of Conduct), the Anti- Discrimination Code for Players and Player Support Personnel, the Anti-\\\\nDoping Code and the Anti-Corruption Code. \\\\n1.2.5 A player or player support personnel who has been suspended from participating in a match shall not, from \\\\nthe toss of the coin and for the remainder of the match thereafter: \\\\n1.2.5.1 Be nominated as, or carry out any of the duties or responsibilities of a substitute fielder, or \\\\n1.2.5.2 Enter any part of the playing area (which shall include the field of play and the area between the \\\\nboundary and the perimeter boards) at any time, including any scheduled or unscheduled breaks in \\\\nplay. \\\\n1.2.6 A player who has been suspended from participating in a match shall be permitted from the toss of the coin \\\\nand for the remainder of the match thereafter be permitted to enter the players’ dressing room provided that \\\\n \\\\n2 \\\\nthe players’ dressing room (or any part thereof) for the match is not within the playing area described in \\\\nclause 1.2.5.2 above (for example, the player is not permitted to enter the on-field ‘dug-out’). \\\\n1.2.7 Concussion Replacement \\\\n1.2.7.1 If a player sustains a concussion or suspected concussion as a result of a head or neck injury during the \\\\ncourse of the relevant match, a Concussion Replacement may be permitted in the following circumstances: \\\\n1.2.7.1.1 the head or neck injury must have been sustained during play and within the playing area \\\\ndescribed in clause 1.2.5.2 above; \\\\n1.2.7.1.2 a concussion or suspected concussion must have been formally diagnosed by the Team Medical \\\\nRepresentative; \\\\n1.2.7.1.3 the Team Medical Representative or Team Manager shall submit a Concussion Replacement \\\\nRequest to the ICC Match Referee on a standard form, which shall: \\\\n1.2.7.1.3.1 identify the player who has sustained the concussion or suspected concussion;  \\\\n1.2.7.1.3.2 specify the incident in which the concussion or suspected concussion was \\\\nsustained, including the time at which it occurred; \\\\n1.2.7.1.3.3 confirm that, following an examination, the Team Medical Representative believes \\\\nor suspects that the player has sustained a concussion as a result of the incident \\\\nspecified in clause 1.2.7.1.3.2 above; and  \\\\n1.2.7.1.3.4 identify the requested Concussion Replacement, who shall be a like-for-like \\\\nreplacement for the player who has sustained the concussion or suspected \\\\nconcussion. \\\\n1.2.7.2 The Concussion Replacement Request must be submitted as soon as possible after the incident specified in \\\\nclause 1.2.7.1.3.2 if a Concussion Replacement is to be permitted. \\\\n1.2.7.3 The ICC Match Referee should ordinarily approve a Concussion Replacement Request if the replacement is \\\\na like-for-like player whose inclusion will not excessively advantage his team for the remainder of the match. \\\\n1.2.7.4 In assessing whether the nominated Concussion Replacement should be considered a like-for-like player, \\\\nthe ICC Match Referee should consider the likely role the concussed player would have played during the \\\\nremainder of the match, and the normal role that would be performed by the nominated Concussion \\\\nReplacement. \\\\n1.2.7.5 If the ICC Match Referee believes that the inclusion of the nominated Concussion Replacement, when \\\\nperforming their normal role, would excessively advantage their team, the ICC Match Referee may impose \\\\nsuch conditions upon the identity and involvement of the Concussion Replacement as he/she sees fit, in line \\\\nwith the overriding objective of facilitating a like-for-like replacement for the concussed player. \\\\nFor clarity, a concussion replacement will not be permitted to bowl during the innings and/or for the \\\\nremainder of the match if the replaced player was suspended from bowling for any reason at the time they \\\\nwere replaced. \\\\n1.2.7.6 The ICC Match Referee may, in reviewing a Concussion Replacement Request made in accordance with \\\\nclause 1.2.7.1.3, request any such further information as may be required in order to make the determination \\\\nrequired under clauses 1.2.7.4 and 1.2.7.5. \\\\n1.2.7.7 The decision of the ICC Match Referee in relation to any Concussion Replacement Request shall be final \\\\nand neither team shall have any right of appeal. \\\\n1.2.7.8 Once the Concussion Replacement has been approved by the ICC Match Referee, the replaced player shall \\\\nplay no further part in the match. \\\\n1.2.7.9 Both the Concussion Replacement and the replaced player shall be considered to have played in the match \\\\nfor records and statistical purposes. \\\\n \\\\n3 \\\\n \\\\n1.3 Captain \\\\n1.3.1 If at any time the captain is not available, a deputy shall act for him. \\\\n1.3.2 If a captain is not available to nominate the players, then any person associated with that team may act as \\\\nhis deputy to do so. See clause1.2. \\\\n1.3.3 At any time after the nomination of the players, only a nominated player can act as deputy in discharging the \\\\nduties and responsibilities of the captain as stated in these Playing Conditions, including at the toss. See \\\\nclause 13.4 (The toss). \\\\n1.4 Responsibility of captains \\\\nThe captains are responsible at all times for ensuring that play is conducted within The Spirit of Cricket as well as \\\\nwithin these Playing Conditions. \\\\n2 THE UMPIRES \\\\n2.1 Appointment and attendance \\\\nThe following rules for the selection and appointment of ODI umpires shall be followed as far as it is practicable to do \\\\nso: \\\\n2.1.1 The umpires shall control the game as required by these Playing Conditions, with absolute impartiality and \\\\nshall be present at the ground at least 1.5 hours before the scheduled start of play. \\\\n2.1.2 The following Match Officials are to be appointed for each ODI Match: \\\\n2.1.2.1 One (1) ICC Match Referee, appointed by the ICC from an ICC Panel of Match Referees. \\\\n2.1.2.2 One (1) on-field umpire, appointed by the ICC from an ICC Panel of Umpires.  \\\\n2.1.2.3 One (1) on-field umpire, appointed by the Home Board from their representatives on an ICC Panel \\\\nof Umpires.  \\\\n2.1.2.4 One (1) third umpire, appointed by the ICC from an ICC Panel of Umpires for DRS matches, or \\\\nappointed by the Home Board from their representatives on an ICC Panel of Umpires for all other \\\\nmatches.

Note particularly \\\\ntherein the interpretation of ‘protective helmet’. \\\\n2.5.4 the wicket-keeper’s gloves comply with the requirements of clause 27.2 (Gloves). \\\\n2.6 Fair and unfair play \\\\nThe umpires shall be the sole judges of fair and unfair play. \\\\n2.7 Fitness for play \\\\n2.7.1 It is solely for the umpires together to decide whether either conditions of ground, weather or light or \\\\nexceptional circumstances mean that it would be dangerous or unreasonable for play to take place. \\\\nConditions shall not be regarded as either dangerous or unreasonable merely because they are not ideal. \\\\nThe fact that the grass and the ball are wet does not warrant the ground conditions being regarded as \\\\nunreasonable or dangerous. \\\\n2.7.2 Conditions shall be regarded as dangerous if there is actual and foreseeable risk to the safety of any player \\\\nor umpire. \\\\n2.7.3 Conditions shall be regarded as unreasonable if, although posing no risk to safety, it would not be sensible \\\\nfor play to proceed. \\\\n2.7.4 If the umpires consider the ground is so wet or slippery as to deprive the bowler of a reasonable foothold, \\\\nthe fielders of the power of free movement, or the batters of the ability to play their strokes or to run between \\\\nthe wickets, then these conditions shall be regarded as so bad that it would be dangerous and unreasonable \\\\nfor play to take place. \\\\n \\\\n5 \\\\n2.8 Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable \\\\ncircumstances \\\\n2.8.1 All references to ground include the pitch. See clause 6.1 (Area of pitch). \\\\n2.8.2 If at any time the umpires together agree that the conditions of ground, weather or light, or any other \\\\ncircumstances are dangerous or unreasonable, they shall immediately suspend play, or not allow play to \\\\nstart or to recommence. The decision as to whether conditions are so bad as to warrant such action is one \\\\nfor the umpires alone to make, following consultation with the ICC Match Referee. \\\\n2.8.3 If circumstances are warranted, the umpires shall stop play and instruct the Ground Authority to take \\\\nwhatever action they can and use whatever equipment is necessary to remove as much dew as possible \\\\nfrom the outfield when conditions become unreasonable or dangerous. The umpires may also instruct the \\\\nground staff to take such action during scheduled and unscheduled breaks in play. \\\\n2.8.4 The umpires shall disregard any shadow on the pitch from the stadium or from any permanent object on the \\\\nground. \\\\n2.8.5 Light Meters \\\\nIt is the responsibility of the ICC to supply light meters to the match officials to be used in accordance with \\\\nthese playing conditions. \\\\n2.8.5.1 All light meters shall be uniformly calibrated. \\\\n2.8.5.2 The umpires shall be entitled to use light meter readings as a guideline for determining whether the \\\\nlight is fit for play in accordance with the criteria set out in clause 2.8.2 above. \\\\n2.8.5.3 Light meter readings may accordingly be used by the umpires: \\\\n2.8.5.3.1 To determine whether there has been at any stage a deterioration or improvement in the light. \\\\n2.8.5.3.2 As benchmarks for the remainder of a match. \\\\n2.8.6 Use of artificial lights \\\\nIf in the opinion of the umpires, natural light is deteriorating to an unfit level, they shall authorize the Ground \\\\nAuthority to use the available artificial lighting so that the match can commence or continue in acceptable \\\\nconditions. \\\\nIn the event of power failure or lights malfunction, the provisions relating to the delay or interruption of play \\\\ndue to bad weather or light shall apply. \\\\n2.8.7 When there is a suspension of play it is the responsibility of the umpires to monitor conditions. They shall \\\\nmake inspections as often as appropriate, unaccompanied by any players or officials. Immediately the \\\\numpires together agree that the conditions are no longer dangerous or unreasonable they shall call upon the \\\\nplayers to resume play. \\\\n2.8.8 The safety of all persons within the ground is of paramount importance to the ICC. In the event that of any \\\\nthreatening circumstance, whether actual or perceived (including for example weather, pitch invasions, act \\\\nof God, etc.), then the umpires, on the advice of the ICC Match Referee, should suspend play and all \\\\nplayers and officials should immediately be asked to leave the field of play in a safe and orderly manner and \\\\nto relocate to a secure and safe area (depending on each particular threat) pending the satisfactory passing \\\\nor resolution of such threat or risk to the reasonable satisfaction of the umpires, the ICC Match Referee, the \\\\nhead of the relevant Ground Authority, the head of ground security and/or the police as the circumstances \\\\nmay require. \\\\n2.8.9 Where play is suspended under clause 2.8.8 above the decision to abandon or resume play shall be the \\\\nresponsibility of the ICC Match Referee who shall act only after consultation with the head of ground security \\\\nand the police. \\\\n \\\\n6 \\\\n2.9 Position of umpires \\\\nThe umpires shall stand where they can best see any act upon which their decision may be required. \\\\nSubject to this over-riding consideration, the bowler’s end umpire shall stand in a position so as not to interfere with \\\\neither the bowler’s run-up or the striker’s view. \\\\nThe striker’s end umpire may elect to stand on the off side instead of the on side of the pitch, provided he/she informs \\\\nthe captain of the fielding side, the striker and the other umpire. \\\\n2.10 Umpires changing ends \\\\nShall not apply. \\\\n2.11 Disagreement and dispute \\\\nWhere there is disagreement or dispute about any matter, the umpires together shall make the final decision. See \\\\nalso clause 31.6 (Consultation by umpires). \\\\n2.12 Umpire’s decision \\\\nAn umpire may alter any decision provided that such alteration is made promptly and does not contradict clause 20.6 \\\\n(Dead ball not to be revoked). This apart, an umpire’s decision, once made, is final. \\\\n2.13 Signals \\\\n2.13.1 The following code of signals shall be used by umpires. \\\\n2.13.1.1 Signals made while the ball is in play \\\\nNo ball - by extending one arm horizontally. \\\\nOut - by raising an index finger above the head. (If not out, the umpire shall call Not out.) \\\\nWide - by extending both arms horizontally. \\\\nDead ball - by crossing and re-crossing the wrists below the waist. \\\\n2.13.1.2 When the ball is dead, the bowler’s end umpire shall repeat the signals in clause 2.13.1.1, with the \\\\nexception of the signal for Out, to the scorers. \\\\n2.13.1.3 The signals listed below shall be made to the scorers only when the ball is dead. \\\\nBoundary 4 - by waving an arm from side to side finishing with the arm across the chest \\\\nBoundary 6 - by raising both arms above the head. \\\\nBye - by raising an open hand above the head. \\\\nFive Penalty runs awarded to the batting side - by repeated tapping of one shoulder with the \\\\nopposite hand. \\\\nFive Penalty runs awarded to the fielding side - by placing one hand on the opposite shoulder. \\\\nLeg bye - by touching a raised knee with the hand. \\\\nRevoke last signal - by touching both shoulders, each with the opposite hand. \\\\nShort run - by bending one arm upwards and touching the nearer shoulder with the tips of the \\\\nfingers. \\\\nFree Hit – after signaling the No ball, the bowler’s end umpire extends one arm straight upwards \\\\nand moves it in a circular motion. \\\\nPowerplay Over – by rotating his arm in a large circle. \\\\nThe following signal is for Level 4 player conduct offences. The signal has two parts, both of which should be \\\\nacknowledged separately by the scorers. \\\\n \\\\n7 \\\\nLevel 4 conduct Part 1 - by putting one arm out to the side of the body and repeatedly raising it and \\\\nlowering it. \\\\nPart 2 - by raising an index finger, held at shoulder height, to the side of the body. \\\\n2.13.1.4 All the signals in clause 2.13.1.3 are to be made by the bowler’s end umpire except that for Short \\\\nrun, which is to be signalled by the umpire at the end where short running occurs. However, the \\\\nbowler’s end umpire shall be responsible both for the final signal of Short run to the scorers and, if \\\\nmore than one run is short, for informing them as to the number of runs to be recorded. \\\\n2.13.2 The umpire shall wait until each signal to the scorers has been separately acknowledged by a scorer before \\\\nallowing play to proceed. \\\\nIf several signals are to be used, they should be given in the order that the events occurred. \\\\n2.14 Informing the umpires \\\\nWherever the umpires are to receive information from captains or other players under these Playing Conditions, it will \\\\nbe sufficient for one umpire to be so informed and for him/her to inform the other umpire. \\\\n2.15 Correctness of scores \\\\nConsultation between umpires and scorers on doubtful points is essential. The umpires shall, throughout the match, \\\\nsatisfy themselves as to the correctness of the number of runs scored, the wickets that have fallen and, where \\\\nappropriate, the number of overs bowled. \\\\nThe umpires shall ensure that they are able to contact the scorers at any time during the match and at its conclusion \\\\nto address any issues relating to the correctness of scores. \\\\n3 THE SCORERS \\\\n3.1 Appointment of scorers \\\\nTwo scorers shall be appointed to record all runs scored, all wickets taken and, where appropriate, number of overs \\\\nbowled. \\\\n3.2 Correctness of scores \\\\nThe scorers shall frequently check to ensure that their records agree and consult with the umpires if necessary. See \\\\nclause 2.15 (Correctness of scores). \\\\n3.3 Acknowledging signals \\\\nThe scorers shall accept all instructions and signals given to them by the umpires and shall immediately acknowledge \\\\neach separate signal. \\\\n4 THE BALL \\\\n4.1 Weight and size \\\\nThe ball, when new, shall weigh not less than 5.5 ounces/155.9 g, nor more than 5.75 ounces/163 g, and shall \\\\nmeasure not less than 8.81 in/22.4 cm, nor more than 9 in/22.9 cm in circumference. \\\\n4.2 Approval and control of balls \\\\n4.2.1 The Home Board shall provide white cricket balls of an approved standard for ODI cricket and spare used \\\\nballs for changing during a match, which shall also be of the same brand. Note: The Home Board shall be \\\\nrequired to advise the Visiting Board of the brand of ball to be used in the match(es) at least 30 days prior to \\\\nthe start of the match(es). \\\\n \\\\n8 \\\\n4.2.2 The fielding captain or his nominee may select the ball with which he wishes to bowl from the supply \\\\nprovided by the Home Board. The fourth umpire shall take a box containing at least 6 new balls to the \\\\ndressing room and supervise the selection of the ball. \\\\n4.2.3 The umpires shall retain possession of the match ball(s) throughout the duration of the match when play is \\\\nnot actually taking place. \\\\n4.2.4 During play umpires shall periodically and irregularly inspect the condition of the ball and shall retain \\\\npossession of it at the fall of a wicket, a drinks interval, or any other disruption in play. \\\\n4.3 New ball \\\\n4.3.1 Each fielding team shall have two new balls for its innings, to be used in alternate overs i.e. one from each \\\\nend. \\\\n4.3.2 In a match reduced to 25 overs or less per side before the first innings commences, each team shall have \\\\nonly one new ball for its Innings. \\\\n4.4 Ball lost or becoming unfit for play \\\\nIf, during play, the ball cannot be found or recovered or the umpires agree that it has become unfit for play through \\\\nnormal use, the umpires shall replace it with a ball which has had wear comparable with that which the previous ball \\\\nhad received before the need for its replacement. When the ball is replaced, the umpire shall inform the batters and \\\\nthe fielding captain. \\\\n5 THE BAT \\\\n5.1 The bat \\\\n5.1.1 The bat consists of two parts, a handle and a blade. \\\\n5.1.2 The basic requirements and measurements of the bat are set out in this clause with detailed specifications in \\\\nparagraph 1 of Appendix B. \\\\n5.2 The handle \\\\n5.2.1 The handle is to be made principally of cane and/or wood. \\\\n5.2.2 The part of the handle that is wholly outside the blade is defined to be the upper portion of the handle. It is a \\\\nstraight shaft for holding the bat. \\\\n5.2.3 The upper portion of the handle may be covered with a grip as defined in paragraph 1.2.2 of Appendix B. \\\\n5.3 The blade \\\\n5.3.1 The blade comprises the whole of the bat apart from the handle as defined in clause 5.2 and in paragraph \\\\n1.3 of Appendix B. \\\\n5.3.2 The blade shall consist solely of wood. \\\\n5.4 Protection and repair \\\\nSubject to the specifications in paragraph 1.4 of Appendix B. and providing clause 5.5 is not contravened, \\\\n5.4.1 solely for the purposes of \\\\neither protection from surface damage to the face, sides and shoulders of the blade \\\\nor repair to the blade after surface damage, \\\\nmaterial that is not rigid, either at the time of its application to the blade or subsequently, may be placed on \\\\nthese surfaces. \\\\n \\\\n9 \\\\n5.4.2 for repair of the blade after damage other than surface damage \\\\n5.4.2.1 solid material may be inserted into the blade. \\\\n5.4.2.2 The only material permitted for any insertion is wood with minimal essential adhesives. \\\\n5.4.3 to prevent damage to the toe, material may be placed on that part of the blade but shall not extend over any \\\\npart of the face, back or sides of the blade. \\\\n5.5 Damage to the ball \\\\n5.5.1 For any part of the bat, covered or uncovered, the hardness of the constituent materials and the surface \\\\ntexture thereof shall not be such that either or both could cause unacceptable damage to the ball. \\\\n5.5.2 Any material placed on any part of the bat, for whatever purpose, shall similarly not be such that it could \\\\ncause unacceptable damage to the ball. \\\\n5.5.3 For the purpose of this clause, unacceptable damage is any change that is greater than normal wear and \\\\ntear caused by the ball striking the uncovered wooden surface of the blade. \\\\n5.6 Contact with the ball \\\\nIn these clauses, \\\\n5.6.1 reference to the bat shall imply that the bat is held in the batter’s hand or a glove worn on his hand, unless \\\\nstated otherwise. \\\\n5.6.2 contact between the ball and any of 5.6.2.1 to 5.6.2.4 \\\\n5.6.2.1 the bat itself \\\\n5.6.2.2 the batter’s hand holding the bat \\\\n5.6.2.3 any part of a glove worn on the batter’s hand holding the bat \\\\n5.6.2.4 any additional materials permitted under 5.4 \\\\nshall be regarded as the ball striking or touching the bat or being struck by the bat. \\\\n5.7 Bat size limits \\\\n5.7.1 The overall length of the bat, when the lower portion of the handle is inserted, shall not be more than 38 \\\\nin/96.52 cm. \\\\n5.7.2 The blade of the bat shall not exceed the following dimensions: \\\\nWidth: 4.25in / 10.8 cm \\\\nDepth: 2.64in / 6.7 cm \\\\nEdges: 1.56in / 4.0cm. \\\\nFurthermore, it should also be able to pass through a bat gauge as described in paragraph 1.6 of Appendix \\\\nB. \\\\n5.7.3 The handle shall not exceed 52% of the overall length of the bat. \\\\n5.7.4 The material permitted for covering the blade in clause 5.4.1 shall not exceed 0.04 in/0.1 cm in thickness. \\\\n5.7.5 The maximum permitted thickness of protective material placed on the toe of the blade is 0.12 in/0.3 cm. \\\\n5.8 Categories of bat \\\\n5.8.1 Type A bats conform to clauses 5.1 to 5.7 inclusive. \\\\n5.8.2 Only Type A bats may be used in ODI matches. \\\\n \\\\n10 \\\\n \\\\n6 THE PITCH \\\\n6.1 Area of pitch \\\\nThe pitch is a rectangular area of the ground 22 yards/20.12 m in length and 10 ft/3.05 m in width. It is bounded at \\\\neither end by the bowling creases and on either side by imaginary lines, one each side of the imaginary line joining \\\\nthe centres of the two middle stumps, each parallel to it and 5 ft/1.52 m from it. If the pitch is next to an artificial pitch \\\\nwhich is closer than 5 ft/1.52 m from the middle stumps, the pitch on that side will extend only to the junction of the \\\\ntwo surfaces. See clauses 8.1 (Description, width and pitching),  7.2 (The bowling crease) and Appendix C. \\\\n6.2 Fitness of pitch for play \\\\nThe umpires shall be the sole judges of the fitness of the pitch for play. See clauses 2.7 (Fitness for play) and 2.8 \\\\n(Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable conditions). \\\\n6.3 Selection and preparation \\\\nBefore the match, the Ground Authority shall be responsible for the selection and preparation of the pitch. During the \\\\nmatch, the umpires shall control its use and maintenance. \\\\n6.3.1 The Ground Authority shall ensure that during the period prior to the start of play and during intervals, the \\\\npitch area shall be roped off so as to prevent unauthorised access. (The pitch area shall include an area at \\\\nleast 2 metres beyond the rectangle made by the crease markings at both ends of the pitch). \\\\n6.3.2 The fourth umpire shall ensure that, prior to the start of play and during any intervals, only authorised staff, \\\\nthe ICC match officials, players, team coaches and authorised television personnel shall be allowed access \\\\nto the pitch area. Such access shall be subject to the following limitations: \\\\n6.3.2.1 Only captains and team coaches may walk on the actual playing surface of the pitch area (outside \\\\nof the crease markings). \\\\n6.3.2.2 Access to the pitch area by television personnel shall be restricted to one camera crew (including \\\\none or two television commentators) of the official licensed television broadcaster(s) (but not news \\\\ncrews). \\\\n6.3.2.3 No spiked footwear shall be permitted. \\\\n6.3.2.4 No one shall be permitted to bounce a ball on the pitch, strike it with a bat or cause damage to the \\\\npitch in any other way. \\\\n6.3.2.5 Access shall not interfere with pitch preparation. \\\\n6.3.3 In the event of any dispute, the ICC Match Referee will rule and his ruling will be final. \\\\n6.4 Changing the pitch \\\\n6.4.1 If the on-field umpires decide that it is dangerous or unreasonable for play to continue on the match pitch, \\\\nthey shall stop play and immediately advise the ICC Match Referee. \\\\n6.4.2 The on-field umpires and the ICC Match Referee shall then consult with both captains. \\\\n6.4.3 If the captains agree to continue, play shall resume. \\\\n6.4.4 If the decision is not to resume play, the on-field umpires together with the ICC Match Referee shall consider \\\\nwhether the existing pitch can be repaired and the match resumed from the point it was stopped. In \\\\nconsidering whether to authorise such repairs, the ICC Match Referee must consider whether this would \\\\nplace either side at an unfair advantage, given the play that had already taken place on the dangerous pitch. \\\\n6.4.5 If the decision is that the existing pitch cannot be repaired, then the match is to be abandoned with the \\\\nfollowing consequences:  \\\\n \\\\n11 \\\\n6.4.5.1 In the event of the required number of overs to constitute a match having been completed at the \\\\ntime the match is abandoned, the result shall be determined according to the provisions of clause \\\\n16.4.2. \\\\n6.4.5.2 In the event of the required number of overs to constitute a match not having been completed, the \\\\nmatch will be abandoned as a no result. \\\\n6.4.6 If the abandonment occurs on the day of the match, the ICC Match Referee shall consult with the Home \\\\nBoard with the objective of finding a way for a new match (including a new nomination of teams and toss) to \\\\ncommence on the same date and venue. Such a match may be played either on the repaired pitch or on \\\\nanother pitch, subject to the ICC Match Referee and the relevant Ground Authority both being satisfied that \\\\nthe new pitch will be of the required ODI standard. The playing time lost between the scheduled start time of \\\\nthe original match and the actual start time of the new match will be covered by the provisions of clause 12. \\\\n6.4.7 If it is not possible to start a new match on the scheduled day of the match, the relevant officials from the \\\\nparticipating Boards shall agree on whether the match can be replayed within the existing tour schedule. \\\\n6.4.8 Throughout the above decision making processes, the ICC Match Referee shall keep informed both \\\\ncaptains and the head of the Ground Authority. The head of the Ground Authority shall ensure that suitable \\\\nand prompt public announcements are made. \\\\n6.5 Non-turf pitches \\\\nAll  ODI matches shall be played on natural turf pitches. \\\\nNote: Prior to the commencement of the series the participating Member Boards may agree to, and then seek the \\\\napproval of, ICC to use a hybrid pitch as an alternate to a natural turf pitch. \\\\nThe use of PVA and other adhesives in the preparation of pitches is not permitted. \\\\n6.6 Junior Cricket \\\\nShall not apply. \\\\n7 THE CREASES \\\\n7.1 The creases \\\\nThe positions of a bowling crease, a popping crease and two return creases shall be marked by white lines, as set \\\\nout in clauses 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4, at each end of the pitch. See paragraph 1 of Appendix C. \\\\n7.2 The bowling crease \\\\nThe bowling crease, which is the back edge of the crease marking, is the line that marks the end of the pitch, as in \\\\nclause 6.1 (Area of pitch). It shall be 8 ft 8 in/2.64 m in length. \\\\n7.3 The popping crease \\\\nThe popping crease, which is the back edge of the crease marking, shall be in front of and parallel to the bowling \\\\ncrease and shall be 4 ft/1.22 m from it. The popping crease shall be marked to a minimum of 15 yards/13.71 m on \\\\neither side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps and shall be considered to be unlimited \\\\nin length. \\\\n7.4 The return creases \\\\nThe return creases, which are the inside edges of the crease markings, shall be at right angles to the popping crease \\\\nat a distance of 4 ft 4 in/1.32 m either side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps. Each \\\\nreturn crease shall be marked from the popping crease to a minimum of 8 ft/2.44 m behind it and shall be considered \\\\nto be unlimited in length. \\\\n \\\\n12 \\\\n7.5 Additional Crease Markings \\\\nAs a guideline to the umpires for the calling of Wides on the offside, the crease markings detailed in paragraph 1 of \\\\nAppendix C may be marked in white at each end of the pitch. \\\\n8 THE WICKETS \\\\n8.1 Description, width and pitching \\\\nTwo sets of wickets shall be pitched opposite and parallel to each other in the centres of the bowling creases. Each \\\\nset shall be 9 in/22.86 cm wide and shall consist of three wooden stumps with two wooden bails on top. See \\\\nparagraph 2 of Appendix B. \\\\n8.2 Size of stumps \\\\nThe tops of the stumps shall be 28 in/71.12 cm above the playing surface and shall be dome shaped except for the \\\\nbail grooves. The portion of a stump above the playing surface shall be cylindrical apart from the domed top, with \\\\ncircular section of diameter not less than 1.38 in/3.50 cm nor more than 1.5 in/3.81 cm. See paragraph 2 of Appendix \\\\nB. \\\\nFor televised matches the Home Board may provide a slightly larger cylindrical stump to accommodate the stump \\\\ncamera. When the larger stump is used, all three stumps must be exactly the same size. \\\\n8.3 The bails \\\\n8.3.1 The bails, when in position on top of the stumps, \\\\n- shall not project more than 0.5 in/1.27 cm above them. \\\\n- shall fit between the stumps without forcing them out of the vertical. \\\\n8.3.2 Each bail shall conform to the following specifications. See paragraph 2 of Appendix B. \\\\nOverall length 4.31 in/10.95 cm \\\\nLength of barrel 2.13 in /5.40 cm \\\\nLonger spigot 1.38 in/3.50 cm \\\\nShorter spigot 0.81 in/2.06 cm. \\\\n8.3.3 The two spigots and the barrel shall have the same centre line. \\\\n8.3.4 Devices aimed at protecting player safety by limiting the distance that a bail can travel off the stumps will be \\\\nallowed, subject to the approval of the Home Board and the ICC. \\\\n8.4 Dispensing with bails \\\\nThe umpires may agree to dispense with the use of bails, if necessary. If they so agree then no bails shall be used at \\\\neither end. The use of bails shall be resumed as soon as conditions permit. See clause 29.5 (Dispensing with bails). \\\\n8.5 LED Wickets \\\\nThe use of approved LED Wickets is permitted. Refer also to paragraphs 3.8.1.6 and 4.2 of Appendix D.  \\\\n9 PREPARATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE PLAYING \\\\nAREA \\\\n9.1 Rolling \\\\nThe pitch shall not be rolled during the match except as permitted in clauses 9.1.1 and 9.1.2. \\\\n \\\\n13 \\\\n9.1.1 Frequency and duration of rolling \\\\nDuring the match the pitch may be rolled at the request of the captain of the side batting second, for a period \\\\nof not more than 7 minutes, before the start of the second innings. \\\\n9.1.2 Rolling after a delayed start \\\\nIn addition to the rolling permitted above, if, after the toss and before the first innings of the match, the start \\\\nis delayed, the captain of the batting side may request that the pitch be rolled for not more than 7 minutes. \\\\nHowever, if the umpires together agree that the delay has had no significant effect on the state of the pitch, \\\\nthey shall refuse such request for rolling of the pitch. \\\\n9.1.3 Choice of rollers \\\\nIf there is more than one roller available the captain of the batting side shall choose which one is to be used. \\\\nThe following shall apply in addition to clause 9.1: \\\\n9.1.4 Prior to the scheduled time for the toss, the artificial drying of the pitch and outfield shall be at the discretion \\\\nof the Ground Authority. Thereafter and throughout the match the drying of the outfield may be undertaken \\\\nat any time by the Ground Authority, but the drying of the affected area of the pitch shall be carried out only \\\\non the instructions and under the supervision of the umpires. The umpires shall be empowered to have the \\\\npitch dried without reference to the captains at any time they are of the opinion that it is unfit for play. \\\\n9.1.5 The umpires may instruct the Ground Authority to use any available equipment, including any roller for the \\\\npurpose of drying the pitch and making it fit for play. \\\\n9.1.6 An absorbent roller may be used to remove water from the covers including the cover on the match pitch. \\\\n9.2 Clearing debris from the pitch \\\\n9.2.1 The pitch shall be cleared of any debris \\\\n9.2.1.1 between innings. This shall precede rolling if any is to take place. \\\\n9.2.1.2 at all intervals for meals. \\\\n9.2.2 The clearance of debris in clause 9.2.1 shall be done by sweeping, except where the umpires consider that \\\\nthis may be detrimental to the surface of the pitch. In this case the debris must be cleared from that area by \\\\nhand, without sweeping. \\\\n9.2.3 In addition to 9.2.1, debris may be cleared from the pitch by hand, without sweeping, before mowing and \\\\nwhenever either umpire considers it necessary. \\\\n9.3 Mowing \\\\n9.3.1 Responsibility for mowing \\\\n9.3.1.1 All mowings which are carried out before the match shall be the sole responsibility of the Ground \\\\nAuthority. \\\\n9.4 Watering the pitch \\\\nThe pitch shall not be watered during the match. \\\\n9.5 Re-marking creases \\\\nCreases shall be re-marked whenever either umpire considers it necessary. \\\\n9.6 Maintenance of footholes \\\\nThe umpires shall ensure that the holes made by the bowlers and batters are cleaned out and dried whenever \\\\nnecessary to facilitate play. \\\\n \\\\n14 \\\\nThe umpires shall allow, if necessary, the returfing of footholes made by the bowlers in their delivery strides, or the \\\\nuse of quick-setting fillings for the same purpose. \\\\nIn addition, the umpires shall see that wherever possible and whenever it is considered necessary, action is taken \\\\nduring all intervals in play to do whatever is practicable to improve the bowler’s footholes.  \\\\n9.7 Securing of footholds and maintenance of pitch \\\\nDuring play, umpires shall allow the players to secure their footholds by the use of sawdust provided that no damage \\\\nto the pitch is caused and that clause 41 (Unfair play) is not contravened. \\\\n9.8 Protection and preparation of adjacent pitches during \\\\nmatches \\\\nThe protection (by way of an appropriate cover) and preparation of pitches which are adjacent to the match pitch will \\\\nbe permitted during the match subject to the following: \\\\n9.8.1 Such measures will only be possible if requested by the Ground Authority and approved by the umpires \\\\nbefore the start of the match. \\\\n9.8.2 Approval should only be granted where such measures are unavoidable and will not compromise the safety \\\\nof the players or their ability to execute their actions with complete freedom. \\\\n9.8.3 The preparation work shall be carried out under the supervision of the fourth umpire. \\\\n9.8.4 The consent of the captains is not required but the umpires shall advise both captains and the ICC Match \\\\nReferee before the start of the match on what has been agreed. \\\\n10 COVERING THE PITCH \\\\n10.1 Before the match \\\\nThe use of covers before the match is the responsibility of the Ground Authority and may include full covering if \\\\nrequired. \\\\nThe pitch shall be entirely protected against rain up to the commencement of play. \\\\nHowever, the Ground Authority shall grant suitable facility to the captains to inspect the pitch before the nomination of \\\\ntheir players and to the umpires to discharge their duties as laid down in clauses 2 (The umpires), 6 (The pitch), 7 \\\\n(The creases), 8 (The wickets), and 9 (Preparation and maintenance of the playing area). \\\\n10.2 During the match \\\\nThe pitch shall be entirely protected against rain up to the commencement of play, and for the duration of the period \\\\nof the match. \\\\nThe covers must totally protect the pitch and also the pitch surroundings, to a minimum of 5 metres either side of the \\\\npitch, and any worn or soft areas in the outfield. \\\\nThe bowlers’ run-ups shall be covered during inclement weather, in order to keep them dry, to a distance of at least \\\\n10 x 10 metres. \\\\n10.3 Removal of covers \\\\nAll covers (including “hessian” or “scrim” covers used to protect the pitch against the sun) shall be removed not later \\\\nthan 2 ½ hours before the scheduled start of play provided it is not raining at the time, but the pitch will be covered \\\\nagain if rain falls prior to the commencement of play. \\\\n \\\\n15 \\\\n11 INTERVALS \\\\n11.1 An interval \\\\n11.1.1 The following shall be classed as intervals. \\\\n- Intervals between innings. \\\\n- Intervals for meals. \\\\n- Intervals for drinks. \\\\n- Any other agreed interval. \\\\n11.1.2 Only these intervals shall be considered as scheduled breaks for the purposes of clause 24.2.6 (fielder \\\\nabsent or leaving the field of play). \\\\n11.2 Duration of interval \\\\n11.2.1 There shall be a 30 minute interval between innings, taken from the call of Time before the interval until the \\\\ncall of Play on resumption after the interval. \\\\n11.3 Allowance for interval between innings \\\\nLaw 11.3 of the Laws of Cricket shall not apply. \\\\n11.4 Changing agreed times of intervals \\\\n11.4.1 If the innings of the team batting first is completed prior to the scheduled time for the interval, the interval \\\\nshall take place immediately and the innings of the team batting second will commence after the interval. \\\\nNote:   The prescribed interval timings above may be reduced by the ICC Match Referee taking into account \\\\nthe intention of not having a prolonged interval after a lengthy interruption close to the conclusion of the \\\\ninnings of the team batting first. However, the minimum interval shall not be less than 10 minutes.  \\\\n11.5 Intervals for drinks \\\\n11.5.1 Two drinks breaks per session shall be permitted, each 1 hour 10 minutes apart. Under conditions of \\\\nextreme heat the umpires may permit extra intervals for drinks.  \\\\n11.5.2 An individual player may be given a drink either on the boundary edge or at the fall of a wicket, on the field, \\\\nprovided that no playing time is wasted. No other drinks shall be taken onto the field without the permission \\\\nof the umpires. Any player taking drinks onto the field shall be dressed in proper cricket attire (subject to the \\\\nwearing of bibs – refer to the note in clause 24.1.4). \\\\n11.6 Scorers to be informed \\\\nThe umpires shall ensure that the scorers are informed of all agreements about hours of play and intervals and of any \\\\nchanges made thereto as permitted under this clause. \\\\n12 START OF PLAY; CESSATION OF PLAY \\\\n12.1 Call of Play \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall call Play before the first ball of the match and on the resumption of play after any \\\\ninterval or interruption. \\\\n12.2 Call of Time \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall call Time, when the ball is dead, at the end of any session of play or as required by \\\\nthese Playing Conditions. See also clause 20.3 (Call of Over or Time). \\\\n \\\\n16 \\\\n12.3 Removal of bails \\\\nAfter the call of Time, the bails shall be removed from both wickets. \\\\n12.4 Starting a new over \\\\nAnother over shall always be started at any time during the match, unless an interval is to be taken in the \\\\ncircumstances set out in clause 12.5.2, if the umpire, walking at normal pace, has arrived at the position behind the \\\\nstumps at the bowler’s end before the time agreed for the next interval has been reached. \\\\n12.5 Completion of an over \\\\nOther than at the end of the match, \\\\n12.5.1 if the agreed time for an interval is reached during an over, the over shall be completed before the interval is \\\\ntaken, except as provided for in clause 12.5.2. \\\\n12.5.2 when less than 3 minutes remains before the time agreed for the next interval, the interval shall be taken \\\\nimmediately if \\\\n  either a batter is dismissed or retires or \\\\n  the players have occasion to leave the field \\\\nwhether this occurs during an over or at the end of an over. Except at the end of an innings, if an over is \\\\nthus interrupted it shall be completed on the resumption of play. \\\\n12.6 Conclusion of match \\\\n12.6.1 The match is concluded \\\\n12.6.1.1 as soon as a result as defined in clauses 16.1 to 16.5 (The result) is reached. \\\\n12.6.1.2 as soon as the prescribed number of overs have been completed \\\\n12.6.2 The match is concluded if, without a conclusion having been reached under 12.6.1, the players leave the \\\\nfield for adverse conditions of ground, weather or light, or in exceptional circumstances, and no further play \\\\nis possible. \\\\n12.7 Hours of Play; Minimum Overs Requirement \\\\n12.7.1 To be determined by the Home Board subject to there being 2 sessions of 3.5 hours each, separated by a \\\\n30 minute interval between innings.  \\\\nNote: The playing hours of matches scheduled to take place at venues where dew is likely to be a factor \\\\nshould be determined so as to ensure that the effect of any dew is minimised. \\\\n12.8 Minimum Over Rates \\\\n12.8.1 The minimum over rate to be achieved in ODI Matches shall be 14.28 overs per hour. \\\\n12.8.2 The actual over rate shall be calculated at the end of each innings by the umpires. \\\\n12.8.3 In calculating the actual over rate for the match, allowances will be given as follows: \\\\n12.8.3.1 The time lost as a result of treatment given to a player by an authorised medical personnel on the \\\\nfield of play; \\\\n12.8.3.2 The time lost as a result of a player being required to leave the field as a result of a serious injury; \\\\n12.8.3.3 The time taken for all third umpire referrals and consultations and any umpire or player reviews; \\\\n12.8.3.4 The time lost as a result of time wasting by the batting side; and \\\\n12.8.3.5 The time lost due to all other circumstances that are beyond the control of the fielding side. \\\\n \\\\n17 \\\\n12.8.4 In the event of any time allowances being granted to the fielding team under clause 12.8.3.4 above (time \\\\nwasting by batting team), then such time shall be deducted from the allowances granted to such batting \\\\nteam in the determination of its over rate. \\\\n12.8.5 If a batting team is bowled out within the time determined for that innings pursuant to these playing \\\\nconditions (taking into account all of the time allowances set out above), the fielding side shall be deemed to \\\\nhave complied with the required minimum over rate. \\\\n12.8.6 The current over rate of the fielding team (+/- overs compared to the minimum rate required), to be advised \\\\nby the 3rd umpire every 30 minutes as a minimum, shall be displayed on a scoreboard or replay screen. \\\\n13 INNINGS \\\\n13.1 Number of innings \\\\n13.1.1 A match shall be one innings for each side. \\\\n13.2 Alternate innings \\\\nEach side shall take their innings alternately. \\\\n13.3 Completed innings \\\\nA side’s innings is to be considered as completed if any of the following applies \\\\n13.3.1 the side is all out. \\\\n13.3.2 at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batter is \\\\navailable to come in. \\\\n13.3.3 the prescribed number of overs have been bowled to the batting side. \\\\n13.4 The toss \\\\nThe captains shall toss a coin for the choice of innings, on the field of play and under the supervision of the ICC \\\\nMatch Referee, not earlier than 30 minutes, nor later than 15 minutes before the scheduled or any rescheduled time \\\\nfor the start of play. Note, however, the provisions of clause 1.3 (Captain). \\\\n13.5 Decision to be notified \\\\nAs soon as the toss is completed, the captain of the side winning the toss shall decide whether to bat or to field and \\\\nshall notify the opposing captain and the umpires of this decision. Once notified, the decision cannot be changed. \\\\n13.6 Duration of Match \\\\n13.6.1 All matches will consist of one innings per side, each innings being limited to a maximum of 50 overs. All \\\\nmatches shall be of one day’s scheduled duration.  \\\\n13.6.2 There shall be no reserve days allocated for any matches. \\\\n13.7 Length of Innings \\\\n13.7.1 Uninterrupted Matches. \\\\n13.7.1.1 Each team shall bat for 50 overs unless all out earlier.  \\\\n13.7.1.2 If the team fielding first fails to bowl the required number of overs by the scheduled time for \\\\ncessation of the first innings, play shall continue until the required number of overs has been \\\\nbowled.  Subject to clause 11.4, the interval shall be fixed at 30 minutes. The team batting second \\\\nshall receive its full quota of 50 overs irrespective of the number of overs it bowled in the scheduled \\\\ntime for the cessation of the first innings.  \\\\n13.7.1.3 If the team batting first is dismissed in less than 50 overs, the team batting second shall be entitled \\\\nto bat for 50 overs.  \\\\n \\\\n18 \\\\n13.7.1.4 If the team fielding second fails to bowl 50 overs by the scheduled cessation time, the hours of play \\\\nshall be extended until the required number of overs has been bowled or a result is achieved.  \\\\n13.7.1.5 Penalties shall apply for slow over rates (refer to the ICC Code of Conduct). \\\\n13.7.2 Delayed or Interrupted Matches  \\\\n13.7.2.1 Delay or Interruption to the Innings of the Team Batting First (see paragraph 1 of Appendix E) \\\\n13.7.2.1.1 When playing time has been lost the revised number of overs to be bowled in the \\\\nmatch shall be based on a rate of 14.28 overs per hour, which is inclusive of the \\\\nprovision of drinks intervals, in the total remaining time available for play. \\\\n13.7.2.1.2 The revision of the number of overs should ensure, whenever possible, that both \\\\nteams have the opportunity of batting for the same number of overs. The team \\\\nbatting second shall not bat for a greater number of overs than the first team unless \\\\nthe latter completed its innings in less than its allocated overs. To constitute a \\\\nmatch, a minimum of 20 overs have to be bowled to the side batting second, \\\\nsubject to a result not being achieved earlier. \\\\n13.7.2.1.3 As soon as the total minutes of playing time remaining is less than the completed \\\\novers faced by Team 1 multiplied by 4.2, then the first innings is terminated and the \\\\nprovisions of 13.7.2.2 below take effect. \\\\n13.7.2.1.4 A fixed time will be specified for the commencement of the interval, and also the \\\\nclose of play for the match, by applying a rate of 14.28 overs per hour. When \\\\ncalculating the length of playing time available for the match, or the length of either \\\\ninnings, the timing and duration of all relative delays, extensions in playing hours, \\\\ninterruptions in play, and intervals, excluding those for drinks, will be taken into \\\\nconsideration. This calculation must not cause the match to finish earlier than the \\\\noriginal or rescheduled time for cessation of play on the final scheduled day for \\\\nplay. If required the original time shall be extended to allow for one extra over for \\\\neach team.  \\\\n13.7.2.1.5 If the team fielding first fails to bowl the revised number of overs by the specified \\\\ntime, play shall continue until the required number of overs have been bowled or \\\\nthe innings is completed.  \\\\n13.7.2.1.6 Penalties shall apply for slow over rates (refer to the ICC Code of Conduct). \\\\n \\\\n13.7.2.2 Delay or Interruption to the innings of the Team Batting Second (see paragraph 2 of Appendix E) \\\\n13.7.2.2.1 When playing time has been lost and, as a result, it is not possible for the team \\\\nbatting second to have the opportunity of receiving its allocated, or revised \\\\nallocation of overs in the playing time available, the number of overs shall be \\\\nreduced at a rate of 14.28 overs per hour, which is inclusive of the provision of \\\\ndrinks intervals, in respect of the lost playing time. Should the calculations result in \\\\na fraction of an over the fraction shall be ignored.  \\\\n13.7.2.2.2 In addition, should the innings of the team batting first have been completed prior to \\\\nthe scheduled, or re-scheduled time for the commencement of the interval, then \\\\nany calculation relating to the revision of overs shall not be effective until an \\\\namount of time equivalent to that by which the second innings started early has \\\\nelapsed.  \\\\n13.7.2.2.3 To constitute a match, a minimum of 20 overs have to be bowled to the team \\\\nbatting second subject to a result not being achieved earlier. \\\\n13.7.2.2.4 The team batting second shall not bat for a greater number of overs than the first \\\\nteam unless the latter completed its innings in less than its allocated overs.  \\\\n13.7.2.2.5 A fixed time will be specified for the close of play by applying a rate of 14.28 overs \\\\nper hour. With the exception of drinks intervals, the timing and duration of all \\\\nrelative delays, extensions in playing hours and interruptions in play, will be taken \\\\ninto consideration in specifying this time.  \\\\n \\\\n19 \\\\n13.7.2.2.6 If the team fielding second fails to bowl the revised overs by the scheduled or re-\\\\nscheduled close of play, the hours of play shall be extended until the overs have \\\\nbeen bowled or a result achieved. \\\\n13.7.2.2.7 Penalties shall apply for slow over rates (refer to the ICC Code of Conduct). \\\\n13.7.3 Extra Time \\\\nThe Home Board and Visiting Board may agree to provide for extra time of up to 90 minutes where the start of play is \\\\ndelayed or play is suspended. \\\\n                                         13.8 Over-Rate Penalties \\\\n13.8.1 The fielding side shall be in position to bowl the first ball of the final over of the innings by the scheduled (or \\\\nre-scheduled) cessation time for the innings (calculated in accordance with clause 13.7). In delayed or interrupted \\\\nmatches where there has been a reduction of 3 or more overs pursuant to clause 13.7.2, the fielding side shall be in \\\\nposition to bowl the first ball of the penultimate over of the innings by the scheduled (or re-scheduled) cessation time \\\\nfor the innings. \\\\n13.8.2 Where this requirement is not met, clause 28.7.2.2.3 shall be varied and from the start of the next over after \\\\nthe point in time at which the cessation time is reached (and for the remainder of the innings) no more than 4 fielders \\\\nshall be permitted outside the fielding restriction area referred to in clause 28.7.2.1. \\\\n13.8.3 Clause 13.8.2 shall not apply where: \\\\n13.8.3.1 a side’s innings is reduced to less than 25 overs, unless the over-rate penalty has been applied prior to such \\\\nreduction; or \\\\n13.8.3.2 a side’s innings is completed prior to the scheduled (or re-scheduled) cessation time for the innings. \\\\n13.8.4 The bowler’s end umpire shall inform the captain of the fielding side, the batter and the other umpire of: \\\\n13.8.4.1 the scheduled cessation time for the innings prior to the start of the innings, and of any re-scheduled \\\\ncessation time following any subsequent interruption to play; and \\\\n13.8.4.2 any time allowances pursuant to clause 12.8.3 as and when they arise. \\\\n13.8.5 Over-rate penalties pursuant to clause 13.8 shall be applied in addition to the relevant provisions under the \\\\nICC Code of Conduct. \\\\n13.8 Number of Overs per Bowler \\\\n13.8.1 No bowler shall bowl more than 10 overs in an innings.  \\\\n13.8.2 In a delayed or interrupted match where the overs are reduced for both teams or for the team bowling \\\\nsecond, no bowler may bowl more than one-fifth of the total overs allowed.  \\\\n13.8.3 Where the total overs is not divisible by 5, one additional over shall be allowed to the maximum number per \\\\nbowler necessary to make up the balance.  \\\\n13.8.4 In the event of a bowler breaking down and being unable to complete an over, the remaining balls will be \\\\nallowed by another bowler. Such part of an over will count as a full over only in so far as each bowler’s limit \\\\nis concerned.  \\\\n13.8.5 The scoreboard shall show the total number of overs bowled and the number of overs bowled by each \\\\nbowler.  \\\\n14 THE FOLLOW-ON \\\\nShall not apply. \\\\n15 DECLARATION AND FORFEITURE \\\\nShall not apply. \\\\n \\\\n20 \\\\n16 THE RESULT \\\\n16.1 A Win – one-innings match \\\\n16.1.1 Unless the winner is determined by DLS (see clause 16.4), the side which has scored in its one innings a \\\\ntotal of runs in excess of that scored by the opposing side in its one completed innings shall win the match. \\\\nSee clause 13.3 (Completed innings). Note also clause 16.5 (Winning hit or extras). \\\\n16.1.2 Save for circumstances where a match is awarded to a team as a consequence of the opposing team’s \\\\nrefusal to play (clause 16.2), a result can be achieved only if both teams have had the opportunity of batting \\\\nfor at least 20 overs, unless one team has been all out in less than 20 overs or unless the team batting \\\\nsecond scores enough runs to win in less than 20 overs. \\\\n16.1.3 Save for circumstances where a match is awarded to a team as a consequence of the opposing team’s \\\\nrefusal to play (clause 16.2), all matches in which both teams have not had an opportunity of batting for a \\\\nminimum of 20 overs, shall be declared a No Result. \\\\n16.2 ICC Match Referee awarding a match \\\\n16.2.1 A match shall be lost by a side which either \\\\n16.2.1.1 concedes defeat or \\\\n16.2.1.2 in the opinion of the ICC Match Referee refuses to play and the ICC Match Referee shall award the \\\\nmatch to the other side. \\\\n16.2.2 If an umpire considers that an action by any player or players might constitute a refusal by either side to play \\\\nthen the umpires together shall inform the ICC Match Referee of this fact. The ICC Match Referee shall \\\\ntogether with the umpires ascertain the cause of the action. If the ICC Match Referee, after due consultation \\\\nwith the umpires, then decides that this action does constitute a refusal to play by one side, he/she shall so \\\\ninform the captain of that side. If the captain persists in the action the ICC Match Referee shall award the \\\\nmatch in accordance with clause 16.2.1.2 above. \\\\n16.2.3 If action as in clause 16.2.2 above takes place after play has started and does not constitute a refusal to \\\\nplay the delay or interruption in play shall be dealt with in the same manner as provided for in clauses 13.7.2 \\\\n(Delayed and Interrupted Matches) and 11.4 (Changing agreed times for intervals) above. \\\\nNote: In addition to the consequences of any refusal to play prescribed under this clause, any such \\\\nrefusal, whether temporary or final, may result in disciplinary action being taken against the captain and \\\\nteam responsible under the ICC Code of Conduct. \\\\n16.3 All other matches – A Tie or No Result \\\\n16.3.1 A Tie \\\\n16.3.1.1 If the teams’ scores are equal after both innings have been completed (if applicable under DLS – \\\\nsee clause 16.4), then a Super Over shall be played. If the Super Over is a tie, then unless \\\\nexceptional circumstances arise (see paragraph 25 of Appendix G) subsequent Super Overs shall \\\\nbe played until there is a winner. Should it not be possible to play or to complete the Super Overs \\\\nneeded to determine a winner, the match shall be tied. \\\\n16.3.2 No Result \\\\n16.3.2.1 See clause 16.1.3 above. \\\\n16.4 Calculation of the Target Score \\\\n16.4.1 Interrupted Matches \\\\n16.4.1.1 If, due to suspension of play after the start of the match, the number of overs in the innings of either \\\\nteam has to be revised to a lesser number than originally allotted (minimum of 20 overs), then a \\\\nrevised target score (to win) should be set for the number of overs which the team batting second \\\\n \\\\n21 \\\\nwill have the opportunity of facing. This revised target is to be calculated using DLS. The target set \\\\nwill always be a whole number and one run less will constitute a Tie. \\\\n16.4.2 Prematurely Terminated Matches \\\\n16.4.2.1 If the innings of the side batting second is suspended (with at least 20 overs bowled) and it is not \\\\npossible for the match to be resumed, the match will be decided by comparison with the DLS ‘Par \\\\nScore’ determined at the instant of the suspension using DLS. If the score is equal to the par score, \\\\nthe match is a Tie. Otherwise the result is a victory, or defeat, by the margin of runs by which the \\\\nscore exceeds, or falls short of, the Par Score. \\\\n16.5 Winning hit or extras \\\\n16.5.1 As soon as a result is reached as defined in clauses 16.1, 16.2 or 16.3.1, the match is at an end. Nothing \\\\nthat happens thereafter, except as in clause 41.17 (Penalty runs), shall be regarded as part of it. Note also \\\\nclause 16.8. \\\\n16.5.2 The side batting last will have scored enough runs to win only if its total of runs is sufficient without including \\\\nany runs completed by the batters before the completion of a catch, or the obstruction of a catch, from which \\\\nthe striker could be dismissed. \\\\n16.5.3 If a boundary is scored before the batters have completed sufficient runs to win the match, the whole of the \\\\nboundary allowance shall be credited to the side’s total and, in the case of a hit by the bat, to the striker’s \\\\nscore. \\\\n16.6 Statement of result \\\\nIf the side batting last wins the match without losing all its wickets, the result shall be stated as a win by the number of \\\\nwickets still then to fall, unless clause 16.4.2.1 (Prematurely Terminated Matches – Calculation of the Target Score) \\\\napplies. \\\\nIf, without having scored a total of runs in excess of the total scored by the opposing side, the innings of the side \\\\nbatting last has been completed, but as the result of an award of 5 Penalty runs its total of runs is then sufficient to \\\\nwin, the result shall be stated as a win to that side by Penalty runs. \\\\nIf the side fielding last wins the match, the result shall be stated as a win by runs. \\\\nIf the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as Match \\\\nConceded or Match Awarded, as the case may be. \\\\n16.7 Correctness of result \\\\nAny decision as to the correctness of the scores shall be the responsibility of the umpires. See clause 2.15 \\\\n(Correctness of scores). \\\\n16.8 Mistakes in scoring \\\\nIf, after the players and umpires have left the field in the belief that the match has been concluded, the umpires \\\\ndiscover that a mistake in scoring has occurred which affects the result then, subject to clause 16.9, they shall adopt \\\\nthe following procedure. \\\\n16.8.1 If, when the players leave the field, the side batting last has not completed its innings and \\\\neither the number of overs to be bowled in that innings has not been completed, or \\\\nthe end of the innings has not been reached, \\\\nthen, unless one side concedes defeat, the umpires shall order play to resume. \\\\nUnless a result is reached sooner, play will then continue, if conditions permit, until the prescribed number of \\\\novers has been completed. The number of overs shall be taken as they were at the call of Time for the \\\\nsupposed conclusion of the match. No account shall be taken of the time between that moment and the \\\\nresumption of play. \\\\n \\\\n22 \\\\n16.8.2 If, at this call of Time, the overs have been completed and no Playing time remains, or if the side batting last \\\\nhas completed its innings, the umpires shall immediately inform both captains of the necessary corrections \\\\nto the scores and to the result. \\\\n16.9 Result not to be changed \\\\nOnce the umpires have agreed with the scorers the correctness of the scores at the conclusion of the match – see \\\\nclauses 2.15 (Correctness of scores) and 3.2 (Correctness of scores) – the result cannot thereafter be changed. \\\\n16.9.1  \\\\nclauses 2.15 (Correctness of scores) and 3.2 (Correctness of scores) – the result cannot thereafter be changed. \\\\n16.10 Points  \\\\n16.10.1 Preliminary Matches  \\\\nIn a competition with three or four Members with ODI status and with a final match or series, the home \\\\nBoard will institute a points system as follows: \\\\nWin                                      2  \\\\nTie, No Result or abandoned 1  \\\\nLoss                  0 \\\\nIn the event of teams finishing on equal points, the right to play in the final match or series will be \\\\ndetermined as follows: \\\\n- The team with the most number of wins \\\\n- If still equal, the team with the most number of wins over the other team(s) who are equal on \\\\npoints and have the same number of wins  \\\\n- If still equal, the team with the highest net run rate  \\\\nIn a match declared as a No Result, run rate is not applicable.  \\\\n16.10.2 Net Run Rate  \\\\nA team’s net run rate is calculated by deducting from the average runs per over scored by that team \\\\nthroughout the competition, the average runs per over scored against that team throughout the competition.  \\\\nIn the event of a team being all out in less than its full quota of overs, the calculation of its net run rate shall \\\\nbe based on the full quota of overs to which it would have been entitled and not on the number of overs in \\\\nwhich the team was dismissed.  \\\\nOnly those matches where results are achieved will count for the purpose of net run rate calculations. Where \\\\na match is abandoned, but a result is achieved under Duckworth/Lewis/Stern, for net run rate purposes \\\\nTeam 1 will be credited with Team 2’s Par Score on abandonment off the same number of overs faced by \\\\nTeam 2.Where a match is concluded with Duckworth/Lewis/Stern having been applied at an earlier point in \\\\nthe match, Team 1 will be credited with 1 run less than the final Target Score for Team 2 off the total number \\\\nof overs allocated to Team 2 to reach the target.  \\\\n17 THE OVER \\\\n17.1 Number of balls \\\\nThe ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 valid balls. \\\\n17.2 Start of an over \\\\nAn over has started when the bowler starts his run-up or, if there is no run-up, starts his action for the first delivery of \\\\nthat over. \\\\n \\\\n23 \\\\n17.3 Validity of balls \\\\n17.3.1 A ball shall not count as one of the 6 balls of the over unless it is delivered, even though, as in clause 38.3 \\\\n(Non-striker leaving his ground early) a batter may be dismissed or some other incident occurs without the \\\\nball having been delivered. \\\\n17.3.2 A ball delivered by the bowler shall not count as one of the 6 balls of the over \\\\n17.3.2.1 if it is called dead, or is to be considered dead, before the striker has had an opportunity to play it. \\\\nSee clause 20.7 (Dead ball; ball counting as one of over). \\\\n17.3.2.2 if it is called dead in the circumstances of clause 20.4.2.6. Note also the special provisions of clause \\\\n20.4.2.5 (Umpire calling and signaling Dead ball) \\\\n17.3.2.3 if it is a No ball. See clause 21 (No ball). \\\\n17.3.2.4 if it is a Wide. See clause 22 (Wide ball). \\\\n17.3.2.5 when any of clauses 24.4 (Player returning without permission), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 41.4 \\\\n(Deliberate attempt to distract striker), or 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of \\\\nbatter) is applied. \\\\n17.3.3 Any deliveries other than those listed in clauses 17.3.1 and 17.3.2 shall be known as valid balls. Only valid \\\\nballs shall count towards the 6 balls of the over. \\\\n17.4 Call of Over \\\\nWhen 6 valid balls have been bowled and when the ball becomes dead, the umpire shall call Over before leaving the \\\\nwicket. See also clause 20.3 (Call of Over or Time). \\\\n17.5 Umpire miscounting \\\\n17.5.1 If the umpire miscounts the number of valid balls, the over as counted by the umpire shall stand. \\\\n17.5.2 If, having miscounted, the umpire allows an over to continue after 6 valid balls have been bowled, he/she \\\\nmay subsequently call Over when the ball becomes dead after any delivery, even if that delivery is not a \\\\nvalid ball. \\\\n17.5.3 Whenever possible, the third umpire shall liaise with the scorers and if possible inform the on-field umpires if \\\\nthe over has been miscounted. \\\\n17.6 Bowler changing ends \\\\nA bowler shall be allowed to change ends as often as desired, provided he does not bowl two overs consecutively, \\\\nnor bowl parts of each of two consecutive overs, in the same innings. \\\\n17.7 Finishing an over \\\\n17.7.1 Other than at the end of an innings, a bowler shall finish an over in progress unless incapacitated or \\\\nsuspended under these Playing Conditions. \\\\n17.7.2 If for any reason, other than the end of an innings, an over is left uncompleted at the start of an interval or \\\\ninterruption, it shall be completed on resumption of play. \\\\n17.8 Bowler incapacitated or suspended during an over \\\\nIf for any reason a bowler is incapacitated while running up to deliver the first ball of an over, or is incapacitated or \\\\nsuspended during an over, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball.  If a bowler is incapacitated or suspended \\\\nduring an over, another bowler shall complete the over from the same end, provided that he does not bowl two overs \\\\nconsecutively, nor bowl parts of each of two consecutive overs, in that innings. \\\\n \\\\n24 \\\\n18 SCORING RUNS \\\\n18.1 A run \\\\nThe score shall be reckoned by runs. A run is scored \\\\n18.1.1 so often as the batters, at any time while the ball is in play, have crossed and made good their ground from \\\\nend to end. \\\\n18.1.2 when a boundary is scored. See clause 19 (Boundaries). \\\\n18.1.3 when Penalty runs are awarded. See clause 18.6. \\\\n18.2 Runs disallowed and runs not scored \\\\nWherever in these Playing Conditions provision is made for the scoring of runs or awarding of penalties, such runs \\\\nand penalties will be subject to any provisions that may be applicable for a run to be disallowed or a run not to be \\\\nscored (see Appendix A 11) or for the non-award of penalties. \\\\nWhen runs are disallowed, the one run penalty for No ball or Wide shall stand and 5 run penalties shall be allowed, \\\\nexcept for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side). \\\\n18.3 Short runs \\\\n18.3.1 A run is short if a batter fails to make good his ground in turning for a further run. \\\\n18.3.2 Although a short run shortens the succeeding one, the latter if completed shall not be regarded as short. A \\\\nstriker setting off for the first run from in front of the popping crease may do so also without penalty. \\\\n18.4 Unintentional short runs \\\\nExcept in the circumstances of clause 18.5, \\\\n18.4.1 if either batter runs a short run, the umpire concerned shall, unless a boundary is scored, call and signal \\\\nShort run as soon as the ball becomes dead and that run shall not be scored. In accordance with paragraph \\\\n2.5 of Appendix D, the third umpire shall review any call of Short run and communicate his/her decision to \\\\nthe relevant on-field umpire. \\\\n18.4.2 if, after either or both batters run short, a boundary is scored the umpire concerned shall disregard the short \\\\nrunning and shall not call or signal Short run, unless the boundary is a result of an overthrow or wilful act of \\\\na fielder (see clause 19.8 – Overthrow or wilful act of fielder). \\\\n18.4.3 if both batters run short in one and the same run, this shall be regarded as only one short run. \\\\n18.4.4 if more than one run is short then, subject to clauses 18.4.2 and 18.4.3, all runs called as short shall not be \\\\nscored. \\\\n18.4.5 if there has been more than one short run, the umpire shall inform the scorers as to the number of runs to be \\\\nrecorded. \\\\n18.5 Deliberate short runs \\\\n18.5.1 If either umpire considers that one or both batters deliberately ran short at that umpire’s end, the umpire \\\\nconcerned shall, when the ball is dead, call and signal Short run and inform the other umpire of what has \\\\noccurred and apply clause 18.5.2. \\\\n18.5.2 The bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\\\n- return any not out batter to his original end \\\\n- signal No ball or Wide to the scorers, if applicable \\\\n \\\\n25 \\\\n- repeat the Short run signal to the scorers \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side \\\\n- award any other 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective \\\\nhelmets belonging to the fielding side) \\\\n- inform the scorers as to the number of runs to be recorded, and \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the \\\\nreason for this action. \\\\n18.6 Runs awarded for penalties \\\\nRuns shall be awarded for penalties under clauses 18.5 (Deliberate short runs), 21 (No ball), 22 (Wide ball), 24.4 \\\\n(Player returning without permission), 26.4 (Penalties for contravention), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 28.3 (Protective \\\\nhelmets belonging to the fielding side) 41 (Unfair play) and 42 (Players’ conduct). Note, however, the restrictions on \\\\nthe award of Penalty runs in clauses 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded), 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the \\\\nfielding side) and 34 (Hit the ball twice). \\\\n18.7 Runs scored for boundaries \\\\nRuns shall be scored for boundary allowances under clause 19 (Boundaries). \\\\n18.8 Runs scored when a batter is dismissed \\\\nWhen a batter is dismissed, any runs for penalties awarded to either side shall stand. \\\\nNo other runs shall be credited to the batting side, except as follows. \\\\n18.8.1 If a batter is dismissed Obstructing the field, the batting side shall also score any runs completed before the \\\\noffence. \\\\nIf, however, the obstruction or distraction prevented a catch being made, no runs other than penalties shall \\\\nbe scored. \\\\n18.8.2 If a batter is dismissed Run out, the batting side shall also score any runs completed before the wicket was  \\\\nfairly broken. \\\\n18.9 Runs scored when the ball becomes dead other than at the \\\\nfall of a wicket \\\\nWhen the ball becomes dead for any reason other than the fall of a wicket, or is called dead by an umpire, unless \\\\nthere is specific provision otherwise in these Playing Conditions, any runs for penalties awarded to either side shall \\\\nbe scored. Note however the provisions of clauses 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded) and 28.3 (Protective helmets \\\\nbelonging to the fielding side). \\\\nAdditionally the batting side shall be credited with all runs completed by the batters before the incident or call of Dead \\\\nball and the run in progress if the batters had already crossed at the instant of the incident or call of Dead ball. Note \\\\nspecifically, however, the provisions of clause 41.5.8 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter). \\\\n18.10 Crediting of runs scored \\\\nUnless stated otherwise in these Playing Conditions, \\\\n18.10.1 if the ball is struck by the bat, all runs scored by the batting side shall be credited to the striker, except for \\\\nthe following: \\\\n- an award of 5 Penalty runs, which shall be scored as Penalty runs \\\\n- the one run penalty for a No ball, which shall be scored as a No ball extra. \\\\n \\\\n26 \\\\n18.10.2 if the ball is not struck by the bat, runs shall be scored as Penalty runs, Byes, Leg byes, No ball extras or \\\\nWides as the case may be. If Byes or Leg byes accrue from a No ball, only the one run penalty for No ball \\\\nshall be scored as such, and the remainder as Byes or Leg byes as appropriate. \\\\n18.10.3 the bowler shall be debited with: \\\\n- all runs scored by the striker \\\\n- all runs scored as No ball extras \\\\n- all runs scored as Wides. \\\\n18.11 Batter returning to original end \\\\n18.11.1 When the striker is dismissed in any of the circumstances in clauses 18.11.1.1 to 18.11.1.57, the not out \\\\nbatter shall return to his original end. \\\\n18.11.1.1 Bowled. \\\\n18.11.1.2 Stumped. \\\\n18.11.1.3 Hit the ball twice. \\\\n18.11.1.4 LBW. \\\\n18.11.1.5 Hit wicket. \\\\n18.11.1.6 Caught \\\\n18.11.1.7 Obstructing the field, where the obstruction or distraction prevents the striker being out caught. \\\\n18.11.2 The batters shall return to their original ends in any of the cases of clauses 18.11.2.1 to 18.11.2.3. \\\\n18.11.2.1 A boundary is scored unless as a result of an overthrow or wilful act of a fielder (see clause 19.8). \\\\n18.11.2.2 Runs are disallowed for any reason. \\\\n18.11.2.3  the batters at the wicket decide to do so, under clause 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or \\\\nobstruction of batter). \\\\n18.12 Batter returning to wicket he has left \\\\n18.12.1 When a batter is dismissed in any of the ways in clauses 18.12.11 to 18.12.1.2, the not out batter shall \\\\nreturn to the wicket he has left but only if the batters had not already crossed at the instant of the incident \\\\ncausing the dismissal. If runs are to be disallowed, however, the not out batter shall return to his original \\\\nend. \\\\n18.12.1.1 Obstructing the field, where the obstruction or distraction does not prevent the striker being out \\\\nCaught. \\\\n18.12.1.2 Run out. \\\\n18.12.2 If, while a run is in progress, the ball becomes dead for any reason other than the dismissal of a batter, the \\\\nbatters shall return to the wickets they had left, but only if they had not already crossed in running when the \\\\nball became dead. If, however, any of the circumstances of clauses 18.11.2.1 to 18.11.2.3 apply, the batters \\\\nshall return to their original ends. \\\\n19 BOUNDARIES \\\\n19.1 Determining the boundary of the field of play \\\\n19.1.1 Before the toss, the umpires shall determine the boundary of the field of play, which shall be fixed for the \\\\nduration of the match. See clause 2.3.42 (Consultation with Home Board). \\\\n19.1.2 The boundary shall be determined such that no part of any sight-screen, will, at any stage of the match, be \\\\nwithin the field of play. \\\\n \\\\n27 \\\\n19.1.3 The aim shall be to maximize the size of the playing area at each venue. With respect to the size of the \\\\nboundaries, no boundary shall be longer than 90 yards (82.29 meters), and no boundary should be shorter \\\\nthan 65 yards (59.43 metres) from the centre of the pitch to be used. \\\\n19.1.4 At all times, there must be 3 yards (2.74 meters) from the boundary rope to the first solid object (advertising \\\\nboards/LEDs, photographers, cameramen, dug outs, covers, perimeter fence) for the player’s safety run off. \\\\n19.1.5    If the boundary is positioned less than 90 yards (82.29 meters) from the centre of the pitch, the boundary \\\\nrope cannot be set at a distance of more than 10 yards (9.14 meters) from the perimeter fence. The 10 \\\\nyards shall be inclusive of the 3 yards (2.74 meters) provided for the player’s safety run off. \\\\n19.1.6    Any ground which has previously been approved to host international cricket which is unable to conform to \\\\nthe minimum boundary dimension shall be exempt. In such cases the boundary shall be positioned so as to \\\\nmaximize the size of the playing area. \\\\n19.2 Identifying and marking the boundary \\\\n19.2.1 All boundaries must be designated by a rope, or similar object of a minimum standard as authorised by the \\\\nICC from time to time.  \\\\n19.2.2 If the boundary is marked by means of an object that is in contact with the ground the boundary will be the \\\\nedge of the grounded part of the object which is nearest the pitch. \\\\n19.2.3 An obstacle within the field of play shall not be regarded as a boundary unless so determined by the umpires \\\\nbefore the toss. See clause 2.3.4 (Consultation with Home Board). \\\\n19.2.4 If an unauthorised person enters the playing arena and handles the ball, the umpire at the bowler’s end shall \\\\nbe the sole judge of whether the boundary allowance should be scored or the ball be treated as still in play \\\\nor called dead ball if a batter is liable to be out as a result of the unauthorised person handling the ball. See \\\\nalso clause 20.4.2.12 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball). \\\\n19.3 Restoring the boundary \\\\nIf a solid object used to mark the boundary is disturbed for any reason, then: \\\\n19.3.1 the boundary shall be considered to be in its original position. \\\\n19.3.2 the object shall be returned to its original position as soon as is practicable; if play is taking place, this shall \\\\nbe as soon as the ball is dead. \\\\n19.3.3 if some part of a fence or other marker has come within the field of play, that part shall be removed from the \\\\nfield of play as soon as is practicable; if play is taking place, this shall be as soon as the ball is dead. \\\\n19.4 Ball grounded beyond the boundary \\\\n19.4.1 The ball in play is grounded beyond the boundary if it touches \\\\n- the boundary or any part of an object used to mark the boundary; \\\\n- the ground beyond the boundary; \\\\n- any object that is grounded beyond the boundary. \\\\n19.4.2 The ball in play is to be regarded as being grounded beyond the boundary if \\\\n- a fielder, grounded beyond the boundary as in clause 19.5, touches the ball; \\\\n- a fielder, after catching the ball within the boundary, becomes grounded beyond the boundary while in \\\\ncontact with the ball, before completing the catch. \\\\n19.5 Fielder grounded beyond the boundary \\\\n19.5.1 A fielder is grounded beyond the boundary if some part of his person is in contact with any of the following: \\\\n \\\\n28 \\\\n- the boundary or any part of an object used to mark the boundary; \\\\n- the ground beyond the boundary; \\\\n- any object that is in contact with the ground beyond the boundary; \\\\n- another fielder who is grounded beyond the boundary. \\\\n19.5.2 A fielder who is not in contact with the ground is considered to be grounded beyond the boundary if his final \\\\ncontact with the ground, before his first contact with the ball after it has been delivered by the bowler, was \\\\nnot entirely within the boundary. \\\\n19.6 Boundary allowances \\\\n19.6.1 6 runs shall be allowed for a boundary 6; and 4 runs for a boundary 4. See also clause 19.7. \\\\n19.7 Runs scored from boundaries \\\\n19.7.1 A boundary 6 will be scored if and only if the ball has been struck by the bat and is first grounded beyond the \\\\nboundary without having been in contact with the ground within the field of play. This shall apply even if the \\\\nball has previously touched a fielder. \\\\n19.7.2 A boundary 4 will be scored when a ball that is grounded beyond the boundary \\\\n- whether struck by the bat or not, was first grounded within the boundary, or \\\\n- has not been struck by the bat. \\\\n19.7.3 When a boundary is scored, the batting side, except in the circumstances of clause 19.8, shall be awarded \\\\nwhichever is the greater of \\\\n19.7.3.1 the allowance for the boundary \\\\n19.7.3.2 the runs completed by the batters together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at \\\\nthe instant the boundary is scored. \\\\n19.7.4 When the runs in clause 19.7.3.2 exceed the boundary allowance they shall replace the boundary allowance \\\\nfor the purposes of clause 18.12.2. \\\\n19.7.5 The scoring of Penalty runs by either side is not affected by the scoring of a boundary. \\\\n19.8 Overthrow or wilful act of fielder \\\\nIf the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be \\\\nany runs for penalties awarded to either side \\\\nand the allowance for the boundary \\\\nand the runs completed by the batters, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of \\\\nthe throw or act. \\\\nClause 18.12.2 (Batter returning to wicket he has left) shall apply as from the instant of the throw or act. \\\\n20 DEAD BALL \\\\n20.1 Ball is dead \\\\n20.1.1 The ball becomes dead when \\\\n20.1.1.1 it is finally settled in the hands of the wicket-keeper or of the bowler. \\\\n20.1.1.2 a boundary is scored. See clause 19.7 (Runs scored from boundaries). \\\\n \\\\n29 \\\\n20.1.1.3 a batter is dismissed. The ball will be deemed to be dead from the instant of the incident causing \\\\nthe dismissal. \\\\n20.1.1.4 whether played or not it becomes trapped between the bat and person of a batter or between items \\\\nof his clothing or equipment. \\\\n20.1.1.5 whether played or not it lodges in the clothing or equipment of a batter or the clothing of an umpire. \\\\n20.1.1.6 there is an award of Penalty runs under either of clauses 24.4 (Player returning without permission) \\\\nor 28.3 (Fielding the ball). The ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n20.1.1.7 there is a contravention of clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side). \\\\n20.1.1.8 the match is concluded in any of the ways stated in clause 12.6 (Conclusion of match). \\\\n20.1.2 The ball shall be considered to be dead when it is clear to the bowler’s end umpire that the fielding side and \\\\nboth batters at the wicket have ceased to regard it as in play. \\\\n20.1.3 In a match where cameras are being used on or over the field of play (e.g. Spidercam), should a ball that \\\\nhas been hit by the batter make contact, while still in play, with the camera, its apparatus or its cable, either \\\\numpire shall call and signal ‘dead ball’. The ball shall not count as one of the over and no runs shall be \\\\nscored. If the delivery was called a No ball it shall count and the No ball penalty shall be applied. No other \\\\nruns (including penalty runs) apart from the No ball penalty shall be scored. \\\\n20.1.4 Should a ball thrown by a fielder make contact with a camera on or over the field of play, its apparatus or its \\\\ncable, either umpire shall call and signal dead ball. Unless this was already a No ball or Wide, the ball shall \\\\ncount as one of the over. All runs scored to that point shall count, plus the run in progress if the batters have \\\\nalready crossed. \\\\n20.1.5 Refer also to paragraph 2.7 of Appendix D. \\\\n20.2 Ball finally settled \\\\nWhether the ball is finally settled or not is a matter for the umpire alone to decide. \\\\n20.3 Call of Over or Time \\\\nNeither the call of Over (see clause 17.4), nor the call of Time (see clause 12.2) is to be made until the ball is dead, \\\\neither under clauses 20.1 or 20.4. \\\\n20.4 Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball \\\\n20.4.1 When the ball has become dead under clause 20.1, the bowler’s end umpire may call and signal Dead ball if \\\\nit is necessary to inform the players. \\\\n20.4.2 Where either umpire is required to call and signal Dead ball under 20.4.2.1 to 20.4.2.14, the ball will be \\\\nconsidered to be dead at the instant of the incident causing the ball to become dead. However, where the \\\\nPlaying Conditions specifically provide for the call to be delayed, so as not to disadvantage the non-\\\\noffending side, under clause 34.4 (Runs permitted from the ball lawfully struck more than once), clause \\\\n41.2.1 (Unfair actions) and clause 42.1.2 (Unacceptable conduct), the ball will be considered to be dead at \\\\nthe point of the call. \\\\nEither umpire shall call and signal Dead ball when \\\\n20.4.2.1 intervening in a case of unfair play. \\\\n20.4.2.2 a possibly serious injury to a player or umpire occurs. \\\\n20.4.2.3 leaving his/her normal position for consultation. \\\\n20.4.2.4 one or both bails fall from the striker’s wicket before the striker has had the opportunity of playing \\\\nthe ball. \\\\n \\\\n30 \\\\n20.4.2.5 the striker is not ready for the delivery of the ball and, if the ball is delivered, makes no attempt to \\\\nplay it. Provided the umpire is satisfied that the striker had adequate reason for not being ready, the \\\\nball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n20.4.2.6 the striker is distracted by any noise or movement or in any other way while preparing to receive, or \\\\nreceiving a delivery. This shall apply whether the source of the distraction is within the match or \\\\noutside it. Note also clause 20.4.2.7. The ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n20.4.2.7 there is an instance of a deliberate attempt to distract under either of clauses 41.4 (Deliberate \\\\nattempt to distract striker) or 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter). The \\\\nball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n20.4.2.8 the bowler drops the ball accidentally before delivery. \\\\n20.4.2.9 the bowler throws the ball towards the striker’s end before entering his/her delivery stride \\\\n20.4.2.10 the ball does not leave the bowler’s hand for any reason other than an attempt to run out the non-\\\\nstriker under clause 38.3 (Non-striker leaving his ground early). \\\\n20.4.2.11 satisfied that the ball in play cannot be recovered. \\\\n20.4.2.12 he/she considers that either side has been disadvantaged by a person, animal or other object within \\\\nthe field of play. However, if both umpires consider the ball would have reached the boundary \\\\nregardless of the intervention, the boundary should stand (see clause 19.2.4 – Identifying and \\\\nmarking the boundary). \\\\n20.4.2.13 the striker attempts to play the ball and no part of his/her person, whether grounded or raised, \\\\nremains within the pitch as defined in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch). \\\\n20.4.2.14 required to do so under any of the Playing Conditions not included above. \\\\n20.5 Ball ceases to be dead \\\\nThe ball ceases to be dead – that is, it comes into play – when the bowler starts his run-up or, if there is no run-up, \\\\nstarts his bowling action. \\\\n20.6 Dead ball not to be revoked \\\\nOnce the ball is dead, no revoking of any decision can bring the ball back into play for that delivery. \\\\n20.7 Dead ball; ball counting as one of over \\\\n20.7.1 When a ball which has been delivered is called dead or is to be considered dead then, other than as in \\\\nclause 20.7.2, \\\\n20.7.1.1 it will not count in the over if the striker has not had an opportunity to play it. \\\\n20.7.1.2 Unless No ball or Wide ball has been called, it will be a valid ball if the striker has had an \\\\nopportunity to play it, except in the circumstances of clauses 20.4.2.6 and 24.4 ( Player returning \\\\nwithout permission), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to distract striker) and 41.5 \\\\n(Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter). \\\\n20.7.2 In clause 20.4.2.5, the ball will not count in the over only if both conditions of not attempting to play the ball \\\\nand having an adequate reason for not being ready are met. Otherwise the delivery will be a valid ball. \\\\n21 NO BALL \\\\n21.1 Mode of delivery \\\\n21.1.1 The umpire shall ascertain whether the bowler intends to bowl right handed or left handed, over or round the \\\\nwicket, and shall so inform the striker. \\\\nIt is unfair if the bowler fails to notify the umpire of a change in his mode of delivery. In this case the umpire \\\\nshall call and signal No ball. \\\\n \\\\n31 \\\\n21.1.2 Underarm bowling shall not be permitted. \\\\n21.2 Fair delivery – the arm \\\\nFor a delivery to be fair in respect of the arm the ball must not be delivered with an Illegal Bowling Action. \\\\nAn Illegal Bowling Action is defined as a bowling action where a bowler’s Elbow Extension exceeds 15 degrees, \\\\nmeasured from the point at which the bowling arm reaches the horizontal until the point at which the ball is released \\\\n(any Elbow Hyperextension shall be discounted for the purposes of determining an Illegal Bowling Action). \\\\nShould either umpire or the ICC Match Referee suspect that a bowler has used an Illegal Bowling Action, they shall \\\\ncomplete the ICC Bowling Action Report Form at the conclusion of the match, as set out in the Illegal Bowling \\\\nRegulations. \\\\n21.3 Ball thrown or delivered underarm – action by umpires \\\\n21.3.1 If, in the opinion of either umpire, the ball has been thrown (where such mode of delivery does not \\\\ncorrespond to the bowler’s normal bowling action) or delivered underarm, he/she shall call and signal No ball \\\\nand, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- warn the bowler, indicating that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall apply to that bowler \\\\nthroughout the innings. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the batters at the wicket of what has occurred. \\\\n21.3.2 If either umpire considers that, in that innings, a further delivery by the same bowler is thrown (where such \\\\nmode of delivery does not correspond to the bowler’s normal bowling action) or delivered underarm, he/she \\\\nshall call and signal No ball and when the ball is dead inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling. The over shall, if \\\\napplicable, be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled the previous over or part thereof \\\\nnor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. The bowler thus suspended shall not bowl again in that \\\\ninnings. \\\\n- inform the batters at the wicket and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the reason for \\\\nthis action. \\\\n21.3.3 The umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the ICC Match \\\\nReferee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n21.4 Bowler throwing towards striker’s end before delivery \\\\nIf the bowler throws the ball towards the striker’s end before entering the delivery stride, it is not a No ball and the \\\\nprocedure stated in 21.3 shall not apply. However, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball under Clause 20.4.2.9. \\\\n21.5 Fair delivery – the feet \\\\nFor a delivery to be fair in respect of the feet, in the delivery stride \\\\n21.5.1 the bowler’s back foot must land within and not touching the return crease appertaining to his stated mode of \\\\ndelivery. \\\\n21.5.2 the bowler’s front foot must land with some part of the foot, whether grounded or raised \\\\n- on the same side of the imaginary line joining the two middle stumps as the return crease described in \\\\nclause 21.5.1, and \\\\n- behind the popping crease. \\\\n \\\\n32 \\\\nThe third umpire shall review television replays of the bowler’s feet landing and, if he/she is satisfied that not all the \\\\nrequirements have been met, advise the bowler’s end umpire who shall in turn immediately call and signal No ball. \\\\nSee clause 41.8 (Bowling of deliberate front foot No ball). \\\\nIn addition, if the third umpire, having reviewed television replays of the front foot landing, judges that the bowler’s \\\\nfront foot did not land with some part of the foot, whether grounded or raised, behind the popping crease, he/she shall \\\\nimmediately advise the bowler’s end umpire who shall in turn immediately call and signal No ball. \\\\n21.6 Bowler breaking wicket in delivering ball \\\\nEither umpire shall call and signal No ball if, other than in an attempt to run out the non-striker under clause 38.3 \\\\n(Non-striker leaving his/her ground early), the bowler breaks the wicket at any time after the ball comes into play and \\\\nbefore completion of the stride after the delivery stride. This shall include any clothing or other object that falls from \\\\nhis person and breaks the wicket. \\\\n21.7 Ball bouncing more than once, rolling along the ground or \\\\npitching off the pitch \\\\nThe umpire shall call and signal No ball if a ball which he/she considers to have been delivered, without having \\\\npreviously touched bat or person of the striker, \\\\n- bounces more than once \\\\n- or rolls along the ground before it reaches the popping crease. \\\\n- or pitches wholly or partially off the pitch as defined in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch) before it reaches the line of the \\\\nstriker’s wicket. \\\\n21.8 Ball causing the striker to leave the pitch or ball coming to \\\\nrest in front of striker’s wicket \\\\nIf a ball delivered by the bowler comes to rest in front of the line of the striker’s wicket, or is so far from the pitch that \\\\nthe striker would need to leave the pitch to attempt to play the ball (see clause 25.6 – Striker’s right to play the ball)  \\\\nwithout having previously touched the bat or person of the striker, the umpire shall call and signal No ball and \\\\nimmediately call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n21.9 Fielder intercepting a delivery \\\\nIf except in the circumstances of clause 27.3 (Position of wicket-keeper) a ball, delivered by the bowler, makes \\\\ncontact with any part of a fielder’s person before it either makes contact with the striker’s bat or person, or it passes \\\\nthe striker’s wicket, the umpire shall call and signal No ball and immediately call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n21.10 Ball bouncing over head height of striker \\\\nSee clauses 22.1.1.2 and 41.6.1.7. \\\\n21.11 Call of No ball for infringement of other clauses \\\\nIn addition to the instances above, No ball is to be called and signalled as required by the following: \\\\nClause 27.3 – Position of wicket-keeper  \\\\nClause 28.4 – Limitation of on side fielders \\\\nClause 28.5 – Fielders not to encroach on pitch \\\\nClause 41.6 – Bowling of dangerous and unfair short pitched deliveries \\\\nClause 41.7 – Bowling of dangerous and unfair non-pitching deliveries \\\\nClause 41.8 – Bowling of deliberate front foot No ball. \\\\n \\\\n33 \\\\n21.12 Revoking a call of No ball \\\\nAn umpire shall revoke the call of No ball if Dead ball is called under any of Laws 20.4.2.4, 20.4.2.5, 20.4.2.6, \\\\n20.4.2.8 or 20.4.2.10 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball). \\\\n21.13 No ball to over-ride Wide \\\\nA call of No ball shall over-ride the call of Wide ball at any time. See clauses 22.1 (Judging a Wide) and 22.2 (Call \\\\nand signal of Wide ball). \\\\n21.14 Ball not dead \\\\nThe ball does not become dead on the call of No ball. \\\\n21.15 Penalty for a No ball \\\\nA penalty of one run shall be awarded instantly on the call of No ball. Unless the call is revoked, the penalty shall \\\\nstand even if a batter is dismissed. It shall be in addition to any other runs scored, any boundary allowance and any \\\\nother runs awarded for penalties. \\\\n21.16 Runs resulting from a No ball – how scored \\\\nThe one run penalty shall be scored as a No ball extra and shall be debited against the bowler. If other Penalty runs \\\\nhave been awarded to either side these shall be scored as stated in clause 41.17 (Penalty runs). Any runs completed \\\\nby the batters or any boundary allowance shall be credited to the striker if the ball has been struck by the bat; \\\\notherwise they shall also be scored as Byes or Leg byes as appropriate. \\\\n21.17 No ball not to count \\\\nA No ball shall not count as one of the over. See clause 17.3 (Validity of balls). \\\\n21.18 Out from a No ball \\\\nWhen No ball has been called, neither batter shall be out under any of the Playing Conditions except clause 34 (Hit \\\\nthe ball twice), clause 37 (Obstructing the field) or clause 38 (Run out). \\\\n21.19 Free Hit  \\\\n21.19.1 In addition to the above, the delivery following a No ball called (all modes of No ball) shall be a free hit for \\\\nwhichever batter is facing it. If the delivery for the free hit is not a legitimate delivery (any kind of No ball or a \\\\nWide ball) then the next delivery will become a free hit for whichever batter is facing it.  \\\\n21.19.2 For any free hit, the striker can be dismissed only under the circumstances that apply for a No ball, even if \\\\nthe delivery for the free hit is called Wide.  \\\\n21.19.3 Neither field changes nor the exchange of individuals between fielding positions are permitted for free hit \\\\ndeliveries unless: \\\\n21.19.3.1 There is a change of striker (the provisions of clause 41.2 shall apply), or \\\\n21.19.3.2 The No Ball was the result of a fielding restriction breach, in which case the field may be changed to \\\\nthe extent of correcting the breach. \\\\n21.19.4 For clarity, the bowler can change his mode of delivery for the free hit delivery. In such circumstances clause \\\\n21.1 shall apply. \\\\n21.19.5 The umpires will signal a free hit by (after the normal No Ball signal) extending one arm straight upwards \\\\nand moving it in a circular motion. \\\\n \\\\n34 \\\\n22 WIDE BALL \\\\n22.1 Judging a Wide \\\\n22.1.1 If the bowler bowls a ball, not being a No ball, the umpire shall adjudge it a Wide if, according to the \\\\ndefinition in clause 22.1.2 \\\\n22.1.1.1 the ball passes wide of where the striker is standing and which also would have passed wide of the \\\\nstriker standing in a normal batting position. \\\\n22.1.1.2 the ball passes above the head height of the striker standing upright at the popping crease. \\\\n22.1.2 The ball will be considered as passing wide of the striker unless it is sufficiently within reach for him to be \\\\nable to hit it with the bat by means of a normal cricket stroke. \\\\n22.1.3 Umpires are instructed to apply very strict and consistent interpretation in regard to this clause in order to \\\\nprevent negative bowling wide of the wicket. \\\\n22.2 Call and signal of Wide ball \\\\nIf the umpire adjudges a delivery to be a Wide he/she shall call and signal Wide ball as soon as the ball passes the \\\\nstriker’s wicket. It shall, however, be considered to have been a Wide from the instant that the bowler entered his \\\\ndelivery stride, even though it cannot be called Wide until it passes the striker’s wicket. \\\\n22.3 Revoking a call of Wide ball \\\\n22.3.1 The umpire shall revoke the call of Wide ball if there is any contact between the ball and the striker’s bat or \\\\nperson before the ball comes into contact with any fielder. \\\\n22.3.2 The umpire shall revoke the call of Wide ball if a delivery is called a No ball. See clause 21.13 (No ball to \\\\nover-ride Wide). \\\\n22.4 Delivery not a Wide \\\\n22.4.1 The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide, if the striker, by moving, either causes the ball to \\\\npass wide of him, as defined in clause 22.1.2 or brings the ball sufficiently within reach to be able to hit it by \\\\nmeans of a normal cricket stroke. \\\\n22.4.2 The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide if the ball touches the striker’s bat or person, but \\\\nonly as the ball passes the striker. \\\\n22.5 Ball not dead \\\\nThe ball does not become dead on the call of Wide ball. \\\\n22.6 Penalty for a Wide \\\\nA penalty of one run shall be awarded instantly on the call of Wide ball. Unless the call is revoked, under clause 22.3, \\\\nthis penalty shall stand even if a batter is dismissed, and shall be in addition to any other runs scored, any boundary \\\\nallowance and any other runs awarded for penalties. \\\\n22.7 Runs resulting from a Wide – how scored \\\\nAll runs completed by the batters or a boundary allowance, together with the penalty for the Wide, shall be scored as \\\\nWide balls. Apart from any award of 5 Penalty runs, all runs resulting from a Wide shall be debited against the bowler. \\\\n22.8 Wide not to count \\\\nA Wide shall not count as one of the over. See clause 17.3 (Validity of balls). \\\\n22.9 Out from a Wide \\\\nWhen Wide ball has been called, neither batter shall be out under any of the Playing Conditions except clause 35 (Hit \\\\nwicket), clause 37 (Obstructing the field), clause 38 (Run out) or clause 39 (Stumped). \\\\n \\\\n35 \\\\n23 BYE AND LEG BYE \\\\n23.1 Byes \\\\nIf the ball, delivered by the bowler, not being a Wide, passes the striker without touching his bat or person, any runs \\\\ncompleted by the batters from that delivery, or a boundary allowance, shall be credited as Byes to the batting side. \\\\nAdditionally, if the delivery is a No ball, the one run penalty for such a delivery shall be incurred. \\\\n23.2 Leg byes \\\\n23.2.1 If a ball delivered by the bowler first strikes the person of the striker, runs shall be scored only if the umpire \\\\nis satisfied that the striker has \\\\neither attempted to play the ball with the bat \\\\nor tried to avoid being hit by the ball. \\\\n23.2.2 If the umpire is satisfied that either of these conditions has been met runs shall be scored as follows. \\\\n23.2.2.1 If there is \\\\neither no subsequent contact with the striker’s bat or person, or \\\\nonly inadvertent contact with the striker’s bat or person \\\\nany runs completed by the batters or a boundary allowance shall be credited to the striker in the \\\\ncase of subsequent contact with his bat but otherwise to the batting side as in clause 23.2.3. \\\\n23.2.2.2 If the striker wilfully makes a lawful second strike, clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once) \\\\nand clause 34.4 (Runs permitted from ball lawfully struck more than once) shall apply. \\\\n23.2.3 The runs in clause 23.2.2.1, unless credited to the striker, shall be scored as Leg byes. \\\\nAdditionally, if the delivery is a No ball, the one run penalty for the No ball shall be incurred. \\\\n23.3 Leg byes not to be awarded \\\\nIf in the circumstance of clause 23.2.1 the umpire considers that neither of the conditions therein has been met, then \\\\nLeg byes shall not be awarded. \\\\nIf the ball does not become dead for any other reason, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball as soon as the ball \\\\nreaches the boundary or at the completion of the first run. \\\\nThe umpire shall then: \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side; \\\\n- return any not out batter to his original end; \\\\n- signal No ball to the scorers if applicable; \\\\n- award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging \\\\nto the fielding side). \\\\n24 FIELDER’S ABSENCE; SUBSTITUTES \\\\n24.1 Substitute fielders \\\\n24.1.1 The umpires shall allow a substitute fielder \\\\n24.1.1.1 if they are satisfied that a fielder has been injured or become ill and that this occurred during the \\\\nmatch, or \\\\n24.1.1.2 for any other wholly acceptable reason. \\\\n \\\\n36 \\\\nIn all other circumstances, a substitute is not allowed. \\\\n24.1.2 A substitute shall not bowl or act as captain but may act as wicket-keeper only with the consent of the \\\\numpires. Note, however, clause 42.4.1. \\\\n24.1.3 A nominated player may bowl or field even though a substitute has previously acted for him, subject to 24.2 \\\\nand 24.3. \\\\n24.1.4 Squad members of the fielding or batting team who are not playing in the match and who are not acting as \\\\nsubstitute fielders shall be required to wear a team training bib whilst on the playing area (including the area \\\\nbetween the boundary and the perimeter fencing). \\\\n24.2 Fielder absent or leaving the field of play \\\\n24.2.1 A player going briefly outside the boundary while carrying out any duties as a fielder is not absent from the \\\\nfield of play nor, for the purposes of this clause, is he to be regarded as having left the field of play. \\\\n24.2.2 If a fielder fails to take the field at the start of play or at any later time, or leaves the field during play, \\\\n24.2.2.1 an umpire shall be informed of the reason for this absence. \\\\n24.2.2.2 he shall not thereafter come on to the field of play during a session of play without the consent of \\\\nthe umpire. See clause 24.4. The umpire shall give such consent as soon as it is practicable. \\\\n24.2.3 If a player is absent from the field for longer than 8 minutes, the following restrictions shall apply to their \\\\nfuture participation in the match: \\\\n24.2.3.1 The player shall not be permitted to bowl in the match until he has either been able to field, or his \\\\nteam has subsequently been batting, for the total length of playing time for which the player was \\\\nabsent (hereafter referred to as Penalty time). A player’s unexpired Penalty time shall be limited to a \\\\nmaximum of 120 minutes. If any unexpired Penalty time remains at the end of an innings, it is \\\\ncarried forward to the next and subsequent innings of the match. \\\\n24.2.3.2 The player shall not be permitted to bat in the match until his team’s batting innings has been in \\\\nprogress for the length of playing time that is equal to the unexpired Penalty time carried forward \\\\nfrom the previous innings. However, once his side has lost five wickets in its batting innings, he may \\\\nbat immediately. If any unexpired penalty time remains at the end of that batting innings, it is carried \\\\nforward to the next and subsequent innings of the match. \\\\n24.2.4 If the player leaves the field before having served all of his Penalty time, the balance is carried forward as \\\\nunserved Penalty time. \\\\n24.2.5 On any occasion of absence, the amount of playing time for which the player is off the field shall be added to \\\\nany Penalty time that remains unserved, subject to a maximum cumulative Penalty time of 120 minutes, and \\\\nthat player shall not bowl until all of his Penalty time has been served. \\\\n24.2.6 For the purposes of clauses 24.2.3.1 and 24.2.3.2, playing time shall comprise the time play is in progress \\\\nexcluding intervals, intervals between innings and official drinks intervals. For clarity, a player’s Penalty time \\\\nwill continue to expire after he is dismissed, for the remainder of his team’s batting innings. \\\\n24.2.7 If there is an unscheduled break in play, the stoppage time shall count as Penalty time served, provided that, \\\\n24.2.7.1 the fielder who was on the field of play at the start of the break either takes the field on the \\\\nresumption of play, or his side is now batting. \\\\n24.2.7.2 the fielder who was already off the field at the start of the break notifies an umpire in person as soon \\\\nas he is able to participate, and either takes the field on the resumption of play, or his side is now \\\\nbatting. Stoppage time before an umpire has been so notified shall not count towards unserved \\\\nPenalty time. \\\\n24.2.8 Any unserved Penalty time shall be carried forward into the next innings of the match, as applicable. \\\\n \\\\n37 \\\\n24.3 Penalty time not incurred \\\\nA nominated player’s absence will not incur Penalty time if, \\\\n24.3.1 he has suffered an external blow during the match and, as a result, has justifiably left the field or is unable to \\\\ntake the field. \\\\n24.3.2 in the opinion of the umpires, the player has been absent or has left the field for other wholly acceptable \\\\nreasons, which shall not include illness or internal injury. \\\\n24.3.3 the player is absent from the field for a period of 8 minutes or less. \\\\n24.4 Player returning without permission \\\\nIf a player comes on to the field of play in contravention of clause 24.2.2 and comes into contact with the ball while it \\\\nis in play, the ball shall immediately become dead. \\\\n- The umpires shall signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers, if applicable. \\\\n- The umpire shall award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\n- Runs completed by the batters shall be scored together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the \\\\ninstant of the offence. \\\\n- The ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n- The umpire shall inform the other umpire, the captain of the fielding side, the batters and, as soon as practicable, \\\\nthe captain of the batting side of the reason for this action. \\\\n25 BATTER’S INNINGS \\\\n25.1 Eligibility to act as a batter \\\\nOnly a nominated player may bat and, subject to clause 25.3, may do so even though a substitute fielder has \\\\npreviously acted for him. \\\\n25.2 Commencement of a batter’s innings \\\\nThe innings of the first two batters, and that of any new batter on the resumption of play after a call of Time, shall \\\\ncommence at the call of Play. At any other time, a batter’s innings shall be considered to have commenced when that \\\\nbatter first steps onto the field of play. \\\\n25.3 Restriction on batter commencing an innings \\\\n25.3.1 If a member of the batting side has unserved Penalty time, see clause 24.2.7, that player shall not be \\\\npermitted to bat until that Penalty time has been served. However, even if the unserved Penalty time has not \\\\nexpired, that player may bat after his side has lost 5 wickets. \\\\n25.3.2 A member of the batting side’s Penalty time is served during Playing time, in the event of an unscheduled \\\\nstoppage, the stoppage time after the batter notifies an umpire in person that he is able to participate shall \\\\ncount as Penalty time served. \\\\n25.3.3 If any unserved Penalty time remains at the end of a team’s innings, it shall be carried forward to the next \\\\ninnings of the match if appropriate. \\\\n25.4 Batter retiring \\\\n25.4.1 A batter may retire at any time during his innings when the ball is dead. The umpires, before allowing play to \\\\nproceed, shall be informed of the reason for a batter retiring. \\\\n25.4.2 If a batter retires because of illness, injury or any other unavoidable cause, that batter is entitled to resume \\\\nhis innings. If for any reason this does not happen, that batter is to be recorded as ‘Retired - not out’. \\\\n \\\\n38 \\\\n25.4.3 If a batter retires for any reason other than as in clause 25.4.2, the innings of that batter may be resumed \\\\nonly with the consent of the opposing captain. If for any reason his innings is not resumed, that batter is to \\\\nbe recorded as ‘Retired - out’. \\\\n25.4.4 If after retiring a batter resumes his innings, subject to the requirements of clauses 25.4.2 and 25.4.3, it shall \\\\nbe only at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of another batter. \\\\n25.5 Runners \\\\nRunners shall not be permitted. \\\\n25.6 Striker’s right to play the ball \\\\nThe striker has a right to play the ball, or to make a legitimate second strike, after it has been delivered, without \\\\ninterference from the wicket-keeper or any other fielder (see clause 27.5 – Restrictions on actions of wicket-keeper \\\\nand clause 27.6 – Interference with wicket-keeper by striker). \\\\nHowever, the striker may only attempt to play the ball if some of his/her bat or person, whether grounded or raised, \\\\nremains within the pitch, as defined in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch). Should no part of the striker’s bat or person remain \\\\nwithin the pitch, whilst the striker is playing the ball, either umpire shall immediately call and signal Dead ball.  \\\\n \\\\n26 PRACTICE ON THE FIELD \\\\n26.1 Practice on the pitch or the rest of the square \\\\n26.1.1 There shall not be any practice on the pitch at any time. \\\\n26.1.2 There shall not be any practice on the rest of the square at any time except with the approval of the umpires. \\\\n26.1.2.1 If approved by the umpires, the use of the square for practice on any day of any match will be \\\\nrestricted to any netted practice area or bowling strips specifically prepared on the edge of the \\\\nsquare for that purpose. \\\\n26.1.2.2 Bowling practice on the bowling strips referred to above shall also be permitted during the interval \\\\n(and change of innings if not the interval) unless the umpires consider that, in the prevailing \\\\nconditions of ground and weather, it will be detrimental to the surface of the square. \\\\n26.2 Practice on the outfield \\\\n26.2.1 On any day of the match, all forms of practice are permitted on the outfield \\\\n- before the start of play \\\\n- after the close of play, and \\\\n - during the interval or between innings \\\\nproviding the umpires are satisfied that such practice will not cause significant deterioration in the condition \\\\nof the outfield. \\\\n26.2.2 Between the call of Play and the call of Time, practice shall be permitted on the outfield, providing that all of \\\\nthe following conditions are met: \\\\n- only the fielders as defined in paragraph 7 of Appendix A participate in such practice. \\\\n- no ball other than the match ball is used for this practice. \\\\n- no bowling practice takes place in the area between the square and the boundary in a direction parallel to \\\\nthe match pitch. \\\\n- the umpires are satisfied that it will not contravene either of clauses 41.3 (The match ball changing its \\\\ncondition) or 41.9 (Time wasting by the fielding side). \\\\n \\\\n39 \\\\nBowling a ball, using a short run up to a player in the outfield is not to be regarded as bowling practice but \\\\nshall be subject to the other conditions in this clause. \\\\n26.3 Trial run-up \\\\nA bowler is permitted to have a trial run-up provided the umpire is satisfied that it will not contravene either of clauses \\\\n41.9 (Time wasting by the fielding side) or 41.12 (Fielder damaging the pitch). \\\\n26.4 Penalties for contravention \\\\nAll forms of practice are subject to the provisions of clauses 41.3 (The match ball – changing its condition), 41.9 \\\\n(Time wasting by the fielding side) and 41.12 (Fielder damaging the pitch). \\\\n26.4.1 If there is a contravention of any of the provisions of clause 26.1 or 26.2, the umpire shall \\\\n- warn the player that the practice is not permitted; \\\\n- inform the other umpire and, as soon as practicable, both captains of the reason for this action. \\\\n26.4.1.1 If the contravention is by a batter at the wicket, the umpire shall inform the other batter and each \\\\nincoming batter that the warning has been issued. The warning shall apply to the team of that player \\\\nthroughout the match. \\\\n26.4.2 If during the match there is any further contravention by any player of that team, the umpire shall \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side; \\\\n- inform the other umpire, the scorers and, as soon as practicable, both captains, and, if the contravention is \\\\nduring play, the batters at the wicket. \\\\n27 THE WICKET-KEEPER \\\\n27.1 Protective equipment \\\\nThe wicket-keeper is the only fielder permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards. If these are worn, they are to \\\\nbe regarded as part of his person for the purposes of clause 28.2 (Fielding the ball). If by the wicket-keeper’s actions \\\\nand positioning when the ball comes into play it is apparent to the umpires that he will not be able to carry out the \\\\nnormal duties of a wicket-keeper, he shall forfeit this right and also the right to be recognised as a wicket-keeper for \\\\nthe purposes of clauses 33.2 (A fair catch), 39 (Stumped), 28.1 (Protective equipment), 28.4 (Limitation of on-side \\\\nfielders) and 28.5 (Fielders not to encroach on pitch). \\\\n27.2 Gloves \\\\n27.2.1 If, as permitted under clause 27.1, the wicket-keeper wears gloves, they shall have no webbing between the \\\\nfingers except joining index finger and thumb, where webbing may be inserted as a means of support. \\\\n27.2.2 If used, the webbing shall be a single piece of non-stretch material which, although it may have facing \\\\nmaterial attached, shall have no reinforcements or tucks. \\\\n27.2.3 The top edge of the webbing shall not protrude beyond the straight line joining the top of the index finger to \\\\nthe top of the thumb and shall be taut when a hand wearing the glove has the thumb fully extended. See \\\\nparagraph 3 of Appendix B. \\\\n27.3 Position of wicket-keeper \\\\n27.3.1 The wicket-keeper shall remain wholly behind the wicket at the striker’s end from the moment the ball comes \\\\ninto play until a ball delivered by the bowler \\\\ntouches the bat or person of the striker, or \\\\npasses the wicket at the striker’s end, or \\\\nthe striker attempts a run. \\\\n \\\\n40 \\\\n27.3.2 In the event of the wicket-keeper contravening this clause, the striker’s end umpire shall call and signal No \\\\nball as soon as applicable after the delivery of the ball. \\\\n27.4 Movement by wicket-keeper \\\\n27.4.1 After the ball comes into play and before it reaches the striker, it is unfair if the wicket-keeper significantly \\\\nalters his position in relation to the striker’s wicket, except for the following: \\\\n27.4.1.1 movement of a few paces forward for a slower delivery, unless in so doing it brings him within reach \\\\nof the wicket. \\\\n27.4.1.2 lateral movement in response to the direction in which the ball has been delivered. \\\\n27.4.1.3 movement in response to the stroke that the striker is playing or that his actions suggest he intends \\\\nto play. However the provisions of clause 27.3 shall apply. \\\\n27.4.2 In the event of unfair movement by the wicket-keeper, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball and \\\\ninform the other umpire of the reason for doing so. The bowler’s end umpire shall then: \\\\n27.4.2.1 award the one-run penalty for Wide or No ball, if applicable  \\\\n27.4.2.2 award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side \\\\n27.4.2.3 inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\n27.4.2.4 inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the ICC \\\\nMatch Referee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the wicket-\\\\nkeeper concerned. \\\\n27.5 Restriction on actions of wicket-keeper \\\\nIf, in the opinion of either umpire, the wicket-keeper interferes with the striker’s right to play the ball and to guard his \\\\nwicket, clause 20.4.2.6 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball) shall apply. \\\\nIf, however, either umpire considers that the interference by the wicket-keeper was wilful, then clause 41.4 \\\\n(Deliberate attempt to distract striker) shall also apply. \\\\n27.6 Interference with wicket-keeper by striker \\\\nIf, in playing at the ball or in the legitimate defence of his wicket, the striker interferes with the wicket-keeper, he shall \\\\nnot be out except as provided for in clause 37.3 (Obstructing a ball from being caught). \\\\n28 THE FIELDER \\\\n28.1 Protective equipment \\\\nNo fielder other than the wicket-keeper shall be permitted to wear gloves or external leg guards. In addition, \\\\nprotection for the hand or fingers may be worn only with the consent of the umpires. \\\\n28.2 Fielding the ball \\\\n28.2.1 A fielder may field the ball with any part of his person (see paragraph 12 of Appendix A), except as in clause \\\\n28.2.1.2. However, he will be deemed to have fielded the ball illegally if, while the ball is in play he wilfully \\\\n28.2.1.1 uses anything other than part of his person to field the ball. \\\\n28.2.1.2 extends his clothing with his hands and uses this to field the ball. \\\\n28.2.1.3 discards a piece of clothing, equipment or any other object which subsequently makes contact with \\\\nthe ball. \\\\n28.2.2 It is not illegal fielding if the ball in play makes contact with a piece of clothing, equipment or any other object \\\\nwhich has accidentally fallen from the fielder’s person, or been dropped by an umpire. \\\\n \\\\n41 \\\\n28.2.3 If a fielder illegally fields the ball, the ball shall immediately become dead and \\\\n- the penalty for a No ball or a Wide shall stand. \\\\n- any runs completed by the batters shall be credited to the batting side, together with the run in progress if \\\\nthe batters had already crossed at the instant of the offence. \\\\n- the ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\nIn addition the umpire shall: \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\n- inform the other umpire and the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. \\\\n28.3 Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side \\\\n28.3.1 Protective helmets, when not in use by fielders, may not be placed on the ground, above the surface except \\\\nbehind the wicket-keeper and in line with both sets of stumps. \\\\n28.3.2 If the ball while in play strikes the protective helmet, placed as described in clause 28.3.1 the ball shall \\\\nimmediately become Dead and, unless 28.3.3. applies: \\\\nthe umpire shall signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers, if applicable \\\\nthe umpire shall award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side; \\\\n28.3.2.1 any runs completed by the batters before the ball strikes the protective helmet shall be scored, \\\\ntogether with the run in progress if the batters had already crossed at the instant of the ball striking \\\\nthe protective helmet. \\\\n28.3.3 If the ball while in play strikes  the protective helmet, placed as described in clause 28.3.1, and the \\\\ncircumstances of clause 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded) or clause 34 (Hit the ball twice) apply, the \\\\numpire shall: \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\\\n- return any not out batter to his original end \\\\n- signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers if applicable \\\\n- award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3.2. \\\\n28.4 Limitation of on side fielders \\\\n28.4.1 At the instant of delivery, there may not be more than 5 fielders on the leg side. \\\\n28.4.2 At the instant of the bowler’s delivery there shall not be more than two fielders, other than the wicket-keeper, \\\\nbehind the popping crease on the on side. A fielder will be considered to be behind the popping crease \\\\nunless the whole of his person whether grounded or in the air is in front of this line. \\\\n28.4.3 In the event of infringement of this clause by any fielder, the striker’s end umpire shall call and signal No \\\\nball. \\\\n28.5 Fielders not to encroach on pitch \\\\nWhile the ball is in play and until the ball has made contact with the striker’s bat or person, or has passed the striker’s \\\\nbat, no fielder, other than the bowler, may have any part of his person grounded on or extended over the pitch. \\\\nIn the event of infringement of this clause by any fielder other than the wicket-keeper, the bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\ncall and signal No ball as soon as possible after delivery of the ball. Note, however, clause 27.3 (Position of wicket-\\\\nkeeper). \\\\n \\\\n42 \\\\n28.6 Movement by any fielder other than the wicket-keeper \\\\n28.6.1 Any movement by any fielder, excluding the wicket-keeper, after the ball comes into play and before the ball \\\\nreaches the striker, is unfair except for the following: \\\\n28.6.1.1 minor adjustments to stance or position in relation to the striker’s wicket. \\\\n28.6.1.2 movement by any fielder, other than a close fielder, towards the striker or the striker’s wicket that \\\\ndoes not significantly alter the position of the fielder. \\\\n28.6.1.3 movement by any fielder in response to the stroke that the striker is playing or that his actions \\\\nsuggest he intends to play. \\\\n28.6.2 In all circumstances clause 28.4 (Limitation of on side fielders) shall apply. \\\\n28.6.3 In the event of such unfair movement, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball and inform the other \\\\numpire of the reason for doing so. The bowler’s end umpire shall then: \\\\n28.6.3.1 award the one-run penalty for Wide or No ball, if applicable  \\\\n28.6.3.2 award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side \\\\n28.6.3.3 inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\n28.6.3.4 inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has \\\\noccurred. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the ICC \\\\nMatch Referee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the fielder \\\\nconcerned. \\\\n28.6.4 Note also the provisions of clause 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to distract striker). See also clause 27.4 \\\\n(Movement by wicket-keeper). \\\\n28.7 Restrictions on the placement of fielders  \\\\n28.7.1 In addition to the restrictions contained in clause 28.4 above, further fielding restrictions shall apply to certain \\\\novers in each innings. The nature of such fielding restrictions and the overs during which they shall apply are \\\\nset out in the following paragraphs.  \\\\n28.7.2 The following fielding restrictions shall apply:  \\\\n28.7.2.1 Two semi-circles shall be drawn on the field of play. The semi-circles shall have as their centre the \\\\nmiddle stump at either end of the pitch. The radius of each of the semi-circles shall be 30 yards \\\\n(27.43 metres). The semi-circles shall be linked by two parallel straight lines drawn on the field. \\\\n(Refer to paragraph 2 of Appendix C). The fielding restriction areas should be marked by \\\\ncontinuous painted white lines or ‘dots’ at 5 yard (4.57 metres) intervals, each ‘dot’ to be covered by \\\\na white plastic or rubber (but not metal) disc measuring 7 inches (18 cm) in diameter.  \\\\n28.7.2.2 At the instant of delivery:  \\\\n28.7.2.2.1 Powerplay 1 - no more than two (2) fielders shall be permitted outside this fielding \\\\nrestriction area. In an innings of 50 overs, these are overs 1 to 10 inclusive.  \\\\n28.7.2.2.2 Powerplay 2 - no more than four (4) fielders shall be permitted outside this fielding \\\\nrestriction area. In an innings of 50 overs, these are overs 11 to 40 inclusive  \\\\n28.7.2.2.3 Powerplay 3 - no more than five (5) fielders shall be permitted outside this fielding \\\\nrestriction area. In an innings of 50 overs, these are overs 41 to 50 inclusive  \\\\n28.7.2.3 In circumstances when the number of overs of the batting team is reduced, the number of overs \\\\nwithin each phase of the innings shall be reduced in accordance with the table below. For the sake \\\\nof clarity, it should be noted that the table shall apply to both the 1st and 2nd innings of the match. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n43 \\\\nInnings duration Powerplay 1 Powerplay 2 Powerplay 3 \\\\n20 4 12 4 \\\\n21 4 13 4 \\\\n22 5 13 4 \\\\n23 5 14 4 \\\\n24 5 14 5 \\\\n25 5 15 5 \\\\n26 5 16 5 \\\\n27 6 16 5 \\\\n28 6 17 5 \\\\n29 6 17 6 \\\\n30 6 18 6 \\\\n31 6 19 6 \\\\n32 7 19 6 \\\\n33 7 20 6 \\\\n34 7 20 7 \\\\n35 7 21 7 \\\\n36 7 22 7 \\\\n37 8 22 7 \\\\n38 8 23 7 \\\\n39 8 23 8 \\\\n40 8 24 8 \\\\n41 8 25 8 \\\\n42 9 25 8 \\\\n43 9 26 8 \\\\n44 9 26 9 \\\\n45 9 27 9 \\\\n46 9 28 9 \\\\n47 10 28 9 \\\\n48 10 29 9 \\\\n49 10 29 10 \\\\n \\\\n28.7.2.4 If play is interrupted during an innings and the table above applies, the Powerplay takes immediate \\\\neffect. For the avoidance of doubt this applies even if the interruption has occurred mid-over. \\\\nIllustrations: \\\\nA 50 over innings is interrupted after 8.3 overs and reduced to 32 overs. The new phases \\\\nare 7+19+6. Therefore the middle phase fielding restrictions take immediate effect when \\\\nplay resumes and last for a further 17.3 overs. The final phase begins after 26 overs have \\\\nbeen bowled. \\\\nA 40 over innings is interrupted after 18.5 overs and reduced to 22 overs. The new phases \\\\nare 5+13+4. When play resumes, the final phase fielding restrictions apply for the \\\\nremaining 3.1 overs. \\\\n28.7.2.5 At the commencement of the middle and final phases of an innings, the umpire shall signal such \\\\ncommencement to the scorers by rotating his arm in a large circle.  \\\\n28.7.2.6 The scoreboard shall indicate the current Powerplay in progress.  \\\\n28.7.2.7 In the event of an infringement of any of the above fielding restrictions, the square leg umpire shall \\\\ncall and signal No ball. \\\\n29 THE WICKET IS BROKEN \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n44 \\\\n29.1 Wicket put down \\\\nThe wicket is broken when at least one bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps, or one or more stumps \\\\nis removed from the ground. \\\\n29.2    Breaking the wicket fairly \\\\n29.2.1 The wicket is broken fairly if a bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps or a stump is \\\\nstruck out of the ground. \\\\n29.2.1.1 by the ball, \\\\n29.2.1.2 by the striker’s bat if held or by any part of the bat that he is holding, \\\\n29.2.1.3 for the purpose of this clause only, by the striker\\'s bat not in hand, or by any part of the bat \\\\nwhich has become detached, \\\\n29.2.1.4 by the striker’s person or by any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached from \\\\nhis person, \\\\n29.2.1.5 by a fielder with his hand or arm, providing that the ball is held in the hand or hands so \\\\nused, or in the hand of the arm so used. \\\\n29.2.1.6 The wicket is also broken fairly if a fielder strikes or pulls a stump out of the ground as in \\\\nclause 29.1.2.5. \\\\n29.2 2 The disturbance of a bail, whether temporary or not, shall not constitute its complete removal from the top of \\\\nthe stumps, but if a bail in falling lodges between two of the stumps this shall be regarded as complete removal. \\\\n29.3 One bail off \\\\nIf one bail is off, it shall be sufficient for the purpose of breaking the wicket to remove the remaining bail or to strike or \\\\npull any of the three stumps out of the ground, in any of the ways stated in clause 29.1. \\\\n29.4 Remaking wicket \\\\nIf a wicket is broken or put down while the ball is in play, it shall not be remade by an umpire until the ball is dead. \\\\nSee clause 20 (Dead ball). Any fielder may, however, while the ball is in play, \\\\n- replace a bail or bails on top of the stumps. \\\\n- put back one or more stumps into the ground where the wicket originally stood. \\\\n29.5 Dispensing with bails \\\\nIf the umpires have agreed to dispense with bails in accordance with clause 8.4 (Dispensing with bails), it is for the \\\\numpire concerned to decide whether or not the wicket has been broken. \\\\n29.5.1 After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been broken fairly if the umpire concerned is satisfied that \\\\nthe wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker’s bat, person or items of his clothing or equipment as described \\\\nin clauses 29.2.1.2, 29.2.1.3 or 29.2.1.4, or by a fielder in the manner described in clause 29.2.1.5. \\\\n29.5.2 If the wicket has already been broken or put down, clause 29.5.1 shall apply to any stump or stumps still in the \\\\nground. Any fielder may replace a stump or stumps, in accordance with clause 29.4, in order to have an opportunity \\\\nof breaking the wicket fairly. \\\\n30 BATTER OUT OF HIS GROUND \\\\n30.1 When out of his ground \\\\n30.1.1 A batter shall be considered to be out of his ground unless some part of his person or bat is grounded \\\\nbehind the popping crease at that end. \\\\n \\\\n45 \\\\n30.1.2 However, a batter shall not be considered to be out of his ground if, in running or diving towards his ground \\\\nand beyond, and having grounded some part of his person or bat beyond the popping crease, there is \\\\nsubsequent loss of contact between the ground and any part of his person or bat, or between the bat and \\\\nperson. \\\\n30.2 Which is a batter’s ground \\\\n30.2.1 If only one batter is within a ground, it is his ground and will remain so even if he is later joined there by the \\\\nother batter. \\\\n30.2.2 If both batters are in the same ground and one of them subsequently leaves it, the ground belongs to the \\\\nbatter who remains in it. \\\\n30.2.3 If there is no batter in either ground, then each ground belongs to whichever batter is nearer to it, or, if the \\\\nbatters are level, to whichever batter was nearer to it immediately prior to their drawing level. \\\\n30.2.4 If a ground belongs to one batter then the other ground belongs to the other batter, irrespective of his \\\\nposition. \\\\n30.3 Position of non-striker \\\\nThe non-striker, when standing at the bowler’s end, should be positioned on the opposite side of the wicket to that \\\\nfrom which the ball is being delivered, unless a request to do otherwise is granted by the umpire. \\\\n31 APPEALS \\\\n31.1 Umpire not to give batter out without an appeal \\\\nNeither umpire shall give a batter out, even though he may be out under these Playing Conditions, unless appealed \\\\nto by a fielder. This shall not debar a batter who is out under these Playing Conditions from leaving the wicket without \\\\nan appeal having been made. Note, however, the provisions of clause 31.7. \\\\n31.2 Batter dismissed \\\\nA batter is dismissed if he is \\\\neither given out by an umpire, on appeal \\\\nor out under these Playing Conditions and leaves the wicket as in clause 31.1. \\\\n31.3 Timing of appeals \\\\nFor an appeal to be valid, it must be made before the bowler begins his run-up or, if there is no run-up, his bowling \\\\naction to deliver the next ball, and before Time has been called. \\\\nThe call of Over does not invalidate an appeal made prior to the start of the following over, provided Time has not \\\\nbeen called. See clauses 12.2 (Call of Time) and 17.2 (Start of an over). \\\\n31.4 Appeal “How’s That?” \\\\nAn appeal “How’s That?” covers all ways of being out. \\\\nRefer also to Appendix D – DRS and Third Umpire Protocol. \\\\n31.5 Answering appeals \\\\nThe striker’s end umpire shall answer all appeals arising out of any of clauses 35 (Hit wicket), 39 (Stumped) or 38 \\\\n(Run out) when this occurs at the wicket-keeper’s end. The bowler’s end umpire shall answer all other appeals. \\\\nWhen an appeal is made, each umpire shall answer on any matter that falls within his jurisdiction. \\\\nWhen a batter has been given Not out, either umpire may answer an appeal, made in accordance with clause 31.3, if \\\\nit is on a further matter and is within his jurisdiction. \\\\n \\\\n46 \\\\n31.6 Consultation by umpires \\\\nEach umpire shall answer appeals on matters within his/her own jurisdiction. If an umpire is doubtful about any point \\\\nthat the other umpire may have been in a better position to see, he/she shall consult the latter on this point of fact and \\\\nshall then give the decision. If, after consultation, there is still doubt remaining, the decision shall be Not out. \\\\n31.7 Batter leaving the wicket under a misapprehension \\\\nAn umpire shall intervene if satisfied that a batter, not having been given out, has left the wicket under a \\\\nmisapprehension of being out. The umpire intervening shall call and signal Dead ball to prevent any further action by \\\\nthe fielding side and shall recall the batter. \\\\nA batter may be recalled at any time up to the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery, unless it is \\\\nthe final wicket of the innings, in which case it should be up to the instant when the umpires leave the field. \\\\n31.8 Withdrawal of an appeal \\\\nThe captain of the fielding side may withdraw an appeal only after obtaining the consent of the umpire within whose \\\\njurisdiction the appeal falls. If such consent is given, the umpire concerned shall, if applicable, revoke the decision \\\\nand recall the batter. \\\\nThe withdrawal of an appeal must be before the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery or, if the \\\\ninnings has been completed, the instant when the umpires leave the field. \\\\n32 BOWLED \\\\n32.1 Out Bowled \\\\n32.1.1 The striker is out Bowled if his wicket is broken by a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a No ball, even if \\\\nit first touches the striker’s bat or person. \\\\n32.1.2 However, the striker shall not be out Bowled if before striking the wicket the ball has been in contact with any \\\\nother player or an umpire. The striker will, however, be subject to clauses 37 (Obstructing the field), 38 (Run \\\\nout) and 39 (Stumped). \\\\n32.2 Bowled to take precedence \\\\nThe striker is out Bowled if his wicket is broken as in clause 32.1, even though a decision against him for any other \\\\nmethod of dismissal would be justified. \\\\n33 CAUGHT \\\\n33.1 Out Caught \\\\nThe striker is out Caught if a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a No ball, touches his bat without having \\\\npreviously been in contact with any fielder, and is subsequently held by a fielder as a fair catch, as described in \\\\nclauses 33.2 and 33.3, before it touches the ground. \\\\n33.2 A fair catch \\\\n33.2.1 A catch will be fair only if, in every case \\\\neither the ball, at any time \\\\nor any fielder in contact with the ball, \\\\nis not grounded beyond the boundary before the catch is completed. Note clauses 19.4 (Ball grounded \\\\nbeyond the boundary) and 19.5 (Fielder grounded beyond the boundary). \\\\n33.2.2 Furthermore, a catch will be fair if any of the following conditions applies: \\\\n \\\\n47 \\\\n33.2.2.1 the ball is held in the hand or hands of a fielder, even if the hand holding the ball is touching the \\\\nground, or is hugged to the body, or lodges in the external protective equipment worn by a fielder, \\\\nor lodges accidentally in a fielder’s clothing. \\\\n33.2.2.2 a fielder catches the ball after it has been lawfully struck more than once by the striker, but only if it \\\\nhas not been grounded since it was first struck. See clause 34 (Hit the ball twice). \\\\n33.2.2.3 a fielder catches the ball after it has touched the wicket, an umpire, another fielder or the other \\\\nbatter. \\\\n33.2.2.4 a fielder catches the ball after it has crossed the boundary in the air, provided that the conditions in \\\\nclause 33.2.1 are met. \\\\n33.2.2.5 the ball is caught off an obstruction within the boundary that is not designated a boundary by the \\\\numpires. \\\\n33.3 Making a catch \\\\nThe act of making a catch shall start from the time when the ball first comes into contact with a fielder’s person and \\\\nshall end when a fielder obtains complete control over both the ball and his own movement. \\\\n33.4 No runs to be scored \\\\nIf the striker is dismissed Caught, runs from that delivery completed by the batters before the completion of the catch \\\\nshall not be scored but any runs for penalties awarded to either side shall stand. The non-striker shall return to his \\\\noriginal end.   See clause 18.11 Batter returning to original end. \\\\n33.5 Caught to take precedence \\\\nIf the criteria of clause 33.1 are met and the striker is not out Bowled, then he is out Caught, even though a decision \\\\nagainst either batter for another method of dismissal would be justified. \\\\n34 HIT THE BALL TWICE \\\\n34.1 Out Hit the ball twice \\\\n34.1.1 The striker is out Hit the ball twice if, while the ball is in play, it strikes any part of his person or is struck by \\\\nhis bat and, before the ball has been touched by a fielder, the striker wilfully strikes it again with his bat or \\\\nperson, other than a hand not holding the bat, except for the sole purpose of guarding his wicket. See clause \\\\n34.3 and clause 37 (Obstructing the field). \\\\n34.1.2 For the purpose of this clause ‘struck’ or ‘strike’ shall include contact with the person of the striker. \\\\n34.1.3  This clause will apply whether or not No ball is called. \\\\n34.2 Not out Hit the ball twice \\\\nThe striker will not be out under this clause if he \\\\n34.2.1 strikes the ball a second or subsequent time in order to return the ball to any fielder.  \\\\nNote, however, the provisions of clause 37.4 (Returning the ball to a fielder). \\\\n34.2.2 wilfully strikes the ball after it has touched a fielder. Note, however the provisions of clause 37.1 (Out \\\\nObstructing the field). \\\\n34.3 Ball lawfully struck more than once \\\\nThe striker may, solely in order to guard his wicket and before the ball has been touched by a fielder, lawfully strike \\\\nthe ball a second or subsequent time with the bat, or with any part of his person other than a hand not holding the \\\\nbat. The striker may guard his wicket even if the delivery is a No ball. \\\\nHowever, the striker may not prevent the ball from being caught by striking the ball more than once in defence of his \\\\nwicket. See clause 37.3 (Obstructing a ball from being caught). \\\\n \\\\n48 \\\\n34.4 Runs permitted from ball lawfully struck more than once \\\\nWhen the ball is lawfully struck more than once, as permitted in clause 34.3, if the ball does not become dead for any \\\\nreason, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball as soon as the ball reaches the boundary or at the completion of \\\\nthe first run. However, the umpire shall delay the call of Dead ball to allow the opportunity for a catch to be \\\\ncompleted. \\\\nThe umpire shall \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\\\n- return any not out batter to his original end \\\\n- signal No ball to the scorers if applicable, and \\\\n- award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging \\\\nto the fielding side). \\\\n34.5 Bowler does not get credit \\\\nThe bowler does not get credit for the wicket. \\\\n35 HIT WICKET \\\\n35.1 Out Hit wicket \\\\n35.1.1 The striker is out Hit wicket if, after the bowler has entered the delivery stride and while the ball is in play, his \\\\nwicket is  broken by either the striker’s bat or person as described in clauses 29.2.1.2 to 29.2.1.4 ( Breaking \\\\nthe wicket fairly) in any of the following circumstances: \\\\n35.1.1.1 in the course of any action taken by him in preparing to receive or in receiving a delivery, \\\\n35.1.1.2 in setting off for the first run immediately after playing or playing at the ball, \\\\n35.1.1.3 if no attempt is made to play the ball, in setting off for the first run, providing that in the opinion of \\\\nthe umpire this is immediately after the striker has had the opportunity of playing the ball, \\\\n35.1.1.4 in lawfully making a second or further stroke for the purpose of guarding his wicket within the \\\\nprovisions of clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once). \\\\n35.1.2 If the striker breaks his wicket  in any of the ways described in clauses 29.2.1.2 to 29.2.1.4 (Breaking the \\\\nwicket fairly) before the bowler has entered the delivery stride, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n35.2 Not out Hit wicket \\\\nThe striker is not out under this clause should his wicket be put down in any of the ways referred to in clause 35.1 if \\\\nany of the following applies: \\\\n- it occurs after the striker has completed any action in receiving the delivery, other than in clauses 35.1.1.2 to \\\\n35.1.1.4. \\\\n- it occurs when the striker is in the act of running, other than setting off immediately for the first run. \\\\n- it occurs when the striker is trying to avoid being run out or stumped. \\\\n- it occurs when the striker is trying to avoid a throw in at any time. \\\\n- the bowler after entering the delivery stride does not deliver the ball. In this case either umpire shall immediately call \\\\nand signal Dead ball. See clause 20.4 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball). \\\\n- the delivery is a No ball. \\\\n \\\\n49 \\\\n35.3 Runs scored \\\\nNo runs shall be scored when the striker is dismissed Hit wicket other than the one-run penalty for a Wide and any \\\\naward of 5 Penalty Runs. \\\\n36 LEG BEFORE WICKET \\\\n36.1 Out LBW \\\\nThe striker is out LBW if all the circumstances set out in clauses 36.1.1 to 36.1.5 apply. \\\\n36.1.1 The bowler delivers a ball, not being a No ball \\\\n36.1.2 the ball, if it is not intercepted full-pitch, pitches in line between wicket and wicket or on the off side of the \\\\nstriker’s wicket \\\\n36.1.3 the ball not having previously touched his bat, the striker intercepts the ball, either full-pitch or after pitching, \\\\nwith any part of his person \\\\n36.1.4 the point of impact, even if above the level of the bails, \\\\neither is between wicket and wicket \\\\nor if the striker has made no genuine attempt to play the ball with the bat, is \\\\nbetween wicket and wicket or outside the line of the off stump. \\\\n36.1.5 but for the interception, the ball would have hit the wicket. \\\\n36.2 Interception of the ball \\\\n36.2.1 In assessing points of impact in clauses 36.1.3, 36.1.4 and 36.1.5, only the first interception is to be \\\\nconsidered. \\\\n36.2.2 In assessing clause 36.1.3, if the bowler’s end umpire is not satisfied that the ball intercepted the batter’s \\\\nperson before it touched the bat, the batter shall be given Not out. \\\\n36.2.3 In assessing clause 36.1.5, it is to be assumed that the path of the ball before interception would have \\\\ncontinued after interception, irrespective of whether the ball might have pitched subsequently or not. \\\\n36.3 Off side of wicket \\\\nThe off side of the striker’s wicket shall be determined by the striker’s batting position at the moment the ball comes \\\\ninto play for that delivery. See paragraph 13 of Appendix A. \\\\n37 OBSTRUCTING THE FIELD \\\\n37.1 Out Obstructing the field \\\\n37.1.1 Either batter is out Obstructing the field if, except in the circumstances of clause 37.2, and while the ball is in \\\\nplay, he wilfully attempts to obstruct or distract the fielding side by word or action. See also clause 34 (Hit \\\\nthe ball twice). \\\\n37.1.2 The striker is out Obstructing the field if, except in the circumstances of clause 37.2, in the act of receiving a \\\\nball delivered by the bowler, he wilfully strikes the ball with a hand not holding the bat. This will apply \\\\nwhether it is the first strike or a second or subsequent strike. The act of receiving the ball shall extend both \\\\nto playing at the ball and to striking the ball more than once in defence of his wicket. \\\\n37.1.3 This clause will apply whether or not No ball is called. \\\\n37.1.4 For the avoidance of doubt, if an umpire feels that a batter, in running between the wickets, has significantly \\\\nchanged his direction without probable cause and thereby obstructed a fielder’s attempt to effect a run out, \\\\n \\\\n50 \\\\nthe batter should, on appeal, be given out, obstructing the field. It shall not be relevant whether a run out \\\\nwould have occurred or not. \\\\nIf the change of direction involves the batter crossing the pitch, clause 41.14 shall also apply. \\\\nSee also paragraph 2.2 of Appendix D. \\\\n37.2 Not out Obstructing the field \\\\nA batter shall not be out Obstructing the field if \\\\nobstruction or distraction is accidental, or \\\\nobstruction is in order to avoid injury, or \\\\nin the case of the striker, he makes a second or subsequent strike to guard his wicket lawfully as in clause 34.3 (Ball \\\\nlawfully struck more than once). However, see clause 37.3. \\\\n37.3 Obstructing a ball from being caught \\\\n37.3.1    If the delivery is not a No ball, the striker is out Obstructing the field if wilful obstruction or distraction by \\\\neither batter prevents the striker being out caught.    \\\\n37.3.2    Clause 37.3.1 shall apply even if an obstruction is caused by the striker in lawfully guarding his wicket under \\\\nthe provision of Clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once). \\\\n37.3.3    If an obstruction or distraction takes place from a No ball then the batter who caused the obstruction or \\\\ndistraction will be out Obstructing the field.  \\\\nHowever, the striker is not out if the obstruction of a catch occurs while defending his/her wicket from a No \\\\nball with a lawful second strike. \\\\n37.4 Returning the ball to a fielder \\\\nEither batter is out Obstructing the field if, at any time while the ball is in play and, without the consent of a fielder, he \\\\nuses the bat or any part of his person to return the ball to any fielder. \\\\n37.5 Runs scored \\\\nWhen either batter is dismissed Obstructing the field, \\\\n37.5.1 unless the obstruction or distraction prevents the striker being out caught, any runs completed by the batters \\\\nbefore the offence shall be scored, together with any one run Penalty for No ball or wide, or any other award \\\\nof 5 Penalty Runs to either side. See clauses 18.6 (Runs awarded for penalties) and 18.8 (Runs scored \\\\nwhen a batter is dismissed). \\\\n37.5.2 if the obstruction or distraction prevents the striker being out caught, any runs completed by the batters shall \\\\nnot be scored but any  award of 5 Penalty Runs to either side shall stand. Clause 18.11 (Batter returning to \\\\noriginal end) will apply. \\\\n37.6 Bowler does not get credit \\\\nThe bowler does not get credit for the wicket. \\\\n38 RUN OUT \\\\n38.1 Out Run out \\\\nEither batter is out Run out, except as in clause 38.2, if, at any time while the ball is in play, \\\\nhe is out of his ground \\\\nand his wicket is fairly broken by either the action of a fielder or \\\\n \\\\n51 \\\\nthe ball rebounding off a fielder’s person \\\\neven though No ball has been called, except in the circumstances of clause 38.2.2.2, and whether or not a run is \\\\nbeing attempted. \\\\n38.2 Batter not out Run out \\\\n38.2.1 A batter is not out Run out in the circumstances of clauses 38.2.1.1 or 38.2.1.2. \\\\n38.2.1.1 He has been within his ground and has subsequently left it to avoid injury, when the wicket is \\\\nbroken. \\\\nNote also the provisions of clause 30.1.2 (When out of his ground). \\\\n38.2.1.2 The ball delivered by the bowler has not made contact with a fielder, before the wicket is put down. \\\\n38.2.2 The striker is not out Run out in any of the circumstances in clauses 38.2.2.1 and 38.2.2.2. \\\\n38.2.2.1 He is out Stumped. See clause 39.1.2 (Out Stumped). \\\\n38.2.2.2 No ball has been called \\\\nand he is out of his ground not attempting a run \\\\nand the wicket is fairly broken by the wicket-keeper without the intervention of another fielder. \\\\n38.3 Non-striker leaving his/her ground early \\\\n38.3.1   If the non-striker is out of his/her ground at any time from the moment the ball comes into play \\\\nuntil the instant when the bowler would normally have been expected to  release the ball, the non -\\\\nstriker is liable to be Run out by the bowler attempting to run him/her out. In these circumstances, the \\\\nnon- striker will be out Run out if he/she is out of his/her ground when his/her wicket is broken  by the \\\\nbowler throwing the ball at the wicket or by the bowler’s hand holding the ball,  whether or not the ball \\\\nis subsequently delivered. \\\\n38.3.2 If the ball is not delivered, \\\\n- if there is an appeal, the umpire shall make his/her decision on the Run out.  \\\\n- if there is no appeal, or if the decision is not out, he/she shall call and signal \\\\nDead ball as soon as possible. \\\\n- the ball shall not count as one in the over. \\\\n38.3.3 If the ball is delivered and there is an appeal, \\\\n- the umpire shall make his/her decision on the Run out. \\\\n- if the non-striker is not dismissed, the ball remains in play and clause 21.6\\\\n (Bowler breaking wicket in delivering ball) shall apply. \\\\n-  if the non-striker is dismissed, the ball shall not count as one in the over. \\\\n \\\\n38.4 Which batter is out \\\\nThe batter out in the circumstances of clause 38.1 is the one whose ground is at the end where the wicket is put \\\\ndown. See clause 30.2 (Which is a batter’s ground). \\\\n38.5 Runs scored \\\\nIf either batter is dismissed Run out, the run in progress when the wicket is put down shall not be scored, but any \\\\nruns completed by the batters shall stand, together with any runs for penalties awarded to either side. See clauses \\\\n18.6 (Runs awarded for penalties) and 18.8 (Runs scored when a batter is dismissed). \\\\n \\\\n52 \\\\n38.6 Bowler does not get credit \\\\nThe bowler does not get credit for the wicket. \\\\n39 STUMPED \\\\n39.1 Out Stumped \\\\n39.1.1 The striker is out Stumped, except as in clause 39.3, if \\\\na ball which is delivered is not called No ball \\\\nand he is out of his ground, other than as in clause 39.3.1 \\\\nand he has not attempted a run \\\\nwhen his wicket is fairly broken by the wicket-keeper without the intervention of another fielder. Note, \\\\nhowever clause 27.3 (Position of wicket-keeper). \\\\n39.1.2 The striker is out Stumped if all the conditions of clause 39.1.1 are satisfied, even though a decision of Run \\\\nout would be justified. \\\\n39.2 Ball rebounding from wicket-keeper’s person \\\\nIf the wicket is broken by the ball, it shall be regarded as having been put down by the wicket-keeper if the ball \\\\nrebounds on to the stumps from any part of the wicket-keeper’s person or equipment or has been kicked or thrown on \\\\nto the stumps by the wicket-keeper. \\\\n39.3 Not out Stumped \\\\n39.3.1 The striker will not be out Stumped if, after having received the delivery, he has left his ground in order to \\\\navoid injury. \\\\n39.3.2 If the striker is not out Stumped he may, except in the circumstances of clause 38.2.2.2 (Batter not out run \\\\nout) be out Run out if the conditions of clause 38.1 (Out Run out) apply. \\\\n                                         39.4 Runs Scored \\\\nWhen a striker is dismissed Stumped from a Wide ball, the one-run penalty shall stand. Note clauses 12.9 \\\\n(Conclusion of match), 16.6 (Winning hit or extras) and 22.2 (Call and signal of Wide ball) mean that if the penalty for \\\\na Wide concludes the match, then a stumping is not possible, but the one-run penalty for the Wide remains. \\\\n \\\\n40 TIMED OUT \\\\n40.1 Out Timed out \\\\n40.1.1 After the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, the incoming batter must, unless Time has been called, \\\\nbe ready to receive the ball or for the other batter to be ready to receive the next ball within 2 minutes of the \\\\ndismissal or retirement. If this requirement is not met, the incoming batter will be out, Timed out. \\\\n40.1.2 In the event of an extended delay in which no batter comes to the wicket, the umpires shall adopt the \\\\nprocedure of clause 16.2 (ICC Match Referee awarding a match). For the purposes of that clause the start \\\\nof the action shall be taken as the expiry of the 2 minutes referred to above. \\\\n40.2 Bowler does not get credit \\\\nThe bowler does not get credit for the wicket. \\\\n \\\\n53 \\\\n41 UNFAIR PLAY \\\\n41.1 Fair and unfair play – responsibility of captains \\\\nThe captains are responsible for ensuring that play is conducted within the Spirit of Cricket, as well as within these \\\\nPlaying Conditions. \\\\n41.2 Fair and unfair play – responsibility of umpires \\\\n41.2.1 The umpires shall be the sole judges of fair and unfair play. If either umpire considers that any action by a \\\\nplayer, not covered by these Playing Conditions, is unfair, he/she shall call and signal Dead ball, if \\\\nappropriate, as soon as it becomes clear that the call will not disadvantage the non-offending side, and \\\\nreport the matter to the other umpire.  \\\\n41.2.1.1 If this is a first offence by that side, the bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- summon the offending player’s captain and issue a first and final warning which shall apply to all members of the \\\\nteam for the remainder of the match. \\\\n- warn the offending player’s captain that any further such offence by any member of his team shall result in the \\\\naward of 5 Penalty runs to the opposing team. \\\\n41.2.1.2 If this is a second or subsequent offence by that side the bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- summon the offending player’s captain and inform him that there has been a further such offence. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side. \\\\n41.2.1.3 The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the player concerned. \\\\n41.3 The match ball – changing its condition \\\\n41.3.1 The umpires shall make frequent and irregular inspections of the ball. In addition, they shall immediately \\\\ninspect the ball if they suspect anyone of attempting to change the condition of the ball, except as permitted \\\\nin clause 41.3.2. \\\\n41.3.2 It is an offence for any player to take any action which changes the condition of the ball. \\\\nExcept in carrying out his normal duties, a batter is not allowed to wilfully damage the ball other than, when \\\\nthe ball is in play, in striking it with the bat. See also clause 5.5 (Damage to the ball). \\\\nA fielder may, however: \\\\n41.3.2.1 polish the ball on his clothing provided that no artificial substance is used, that the only natural \\\\nsubstance used is sweat, and that such polishing wastes no time. \\\\n41.3.2.2 remove mud from the ball under the supervision of an umpire. \\\\n41.3.2.3 dry a wet ball on a piece of cloth that has been approved by the umpires. \\\\n41.3.3 The umpires shall consider the condition of the ball to have been unfairly changed if any action by any \\\\nplayer does not comply with the conditions in clause 41.3.2. \\\\n41.3.4 If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly changed by a member or \\\\nmembers of either side, or that its condition is inconsistent with the use it has received, they shall consider \\\\nthat there has been a contravention of this clause and decide together whether they can identify the \\\\nplayer(s) responsible for such conduct. \\\\n41.3.5 If it is possible to identify the player(s) responsible for changing the condition of the ball, the umpires shall: \\\\n \\\\n54 \\\\n41.3.5.1 Subject to clause 41.3.2 above, change the ball forthwith.  \\\\n41.3.5.1.1 If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly changed \\\\nby a member or members of the fielding side, the batter at the wicket shall choose the \\\\nreplacement ball from a selection of six other balls of various degrees of usage \\\\n(including a new ball) and of the same brand as the ball in use prior to the \\\\ncontravention. \\\\n41.3.5.1.2 If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly changed \\\\nby a member or members of the batting side, the umpires shall select and bring into \\\\nuse immediately, a ball which shall have wear comparable to that of the previous ball \\\\nimmediately prior to the contravention. \\\\n41.3.5.2 Additionally, the bowler’s end umpire shall: \\\\n41.3.5.2.1 award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side; \\\\n41.3.5.2.2 if appropriate, inform the batters at the wicket and the captain of the fielding side that \\\\nthe ball has been changed and the reason for their action; and \\\\n41.3.5.2.3 inform the captain of the batting side as soon as practicable of what has occurred. \\\\n41.3.5.3 The umpires shall then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such \\\\naction as is considered appropriate against the player(s) concerned. \\\\n41.3.6 If it is not possible to identify the player(s) responsible for changing the condition of the ball, the umpires \\\\nshall: \\\\n41.3.6.1 Change the ball forthwith. The umpires shall choose the replacement ball for one of similar wear \\\\nand of the same brand as the ball in use prior to the contravention; \\\\n41.3.6.2 The bowler’s end umpire shall issue the captain with a first and final warning, and \\\\n41.3.6.3 Advise the captain that should there be any further instances of changing the condition of the ball \\\\nby that team during the remainder of the series, clause 41.3.5.1.2 above will be adopted, with the \\\\ncaptain deemed to be the player responsible for the contravention. \\\\n41.4 Deliberate attempt to distract striker \\\\n41.4.1 It is unfair for any fielder deliberately to attempt to distract the striker while he is preparing to receive or \\\\nreceiving a delivery. \\\\n41.4.2 If either umpire considers that any action by a fielder is such an attempt, he/she shall immediately call and \\\\nsignal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. The bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side, the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting \\\\nside of the reason for the action. \\\\nNeither batter shall be dismissed from that delivery and the ball shall not count as one of the over. However, \\\\nif either umpire had reason to call and signal No ball, he/she shall do so regardless of the attempt to distract, \\\\nand this call shall stand \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the fielder concerned.  \\\\n41.5 Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter \\\\n41.5.1 In addition to clause 41.4, it is unfair for any fielder wilfully to attempt, by word or action, to distract, deceive \\\\nor obstruct either batter after the striker has received the ball. \\\\n41.5.2 It is for either one of the umpires to decide whether any distraction, deception or obstruction is wilful or not. \\\\n41.5.3 If either umpire considers that a fielder has caused or attempted to cause such a distraction, deception or \\\\nobstruction, he/she shall immediately call and signal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for \\\\nthe call. \\\\n \\\\n55 \\\\n41.5.4 Neither batter shall be dismissed from that delivery. \\\\n41.5.5 If an obstruction involves physical contact, the umpires together shall decide whether or not an offence \\\\nunder clause 42 (Players’ conduct) has been committed. \\\\n41.5.5.1 If an offence under clause 42 (Players’ conduct) has been committed, they shall apply the relevant \\\\nprocedures in clause 42 and shall also apply each of clauses 41.5.7 to 41.5.9. \\\\n41.5.5.2 If they consider that there has been no offence under clause 42 (Players’ conduct), they shall apply \\\\neach of clauses 41.5.6 to 41.5.10. \\\\n41.5.6 The bowler’s end umpire shall; \\\\n- Signal No ball or Wide to the scorers, if applicable. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action and as soon as practicable inform the \\\\ncaptain of the batting side. \\\\n41.5.7 The ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n41.5.8 Any runs completed by the batters before the offence shall be scored, together with any runs for penalties \\\\nawarded to either side. Additionally, the run in progress shall be scored whether or not the batters had \\\\nalready crossed at the instant of the offence. \\\\n41.5.9 The batters at the wicket shall decide which of them is to face the next delivery. \\\\n41.5.10 The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the fielder concerned. \\\\n41.6 Bowling of dangerous and unfair short pitched deliveries \\\\n41.6.1 Notwithstanding clause 41.6.2, the bowling of short pitched deliveries is dangerous if the bowler’s end \\\\numpire considers that, taking into consideration the skill of the striker, by their speed, length, height and \\\\ndirection they are likely to inflict physical injury on him. The fact that the striker is wearing protective \\\\nequipment shall be disregarded. \\\\nIn the first instance the umpire decides that the bowling of short pitched deliveries has become dangerous \\\\nunder clause 41.6.1 \\\\n41.6.1.1 The umpire shall call and signal No ball, and when the ball is dead, caution the bowler and inform \\\\nthe other umpire, the captain of the fielding side and the batters of what has occurred. This caution \\\\nshall apply to that bowler throughout the innings. \\\\n41.6.1.2 If there is a second instance, the umpire shall repeat the above procedure and indicate to the \\\\nbowler that this is a final warning, which shall apply to that bowler throughout the innings. \\\\n41.6.1.3 Should there be any further instance by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall \\\\n- call and signal No ball \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately \\\\nfrom bowling \\\\n- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any \\\\npart of the previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\n- The umpire shall inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting \\\\nside. \\\\n \\\\n56 \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as \\\\nis considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.6.1.4 A bowler shall be limited to two fast short-pitched deliveries per over. \\\\n41.6.1.5 A fast short-pitched delivery is defined as a ball, which passes or would have passed above the \\\\nshoulder height of the striker standing upright at the popping crease. \\\\n41.6.1.6 The umpire at the bowler’s end shall advise the bowler and the batter on strike when each fast short \\\\npitched delivery has been bowled. \\\\n41.6.1.7 In addition, a ball that passes above head height of the batter, standing upright at the popping \\\\ncrease, that prevents him from being able to hit it with his bat by means of a normal cricket stroke \\\\nshall be called a Wide. See also clause 22.1.1.2 \\\\n41.6.1.7.1 For the avoidance of doubt any fast short pitched delivery that is called a Wide under this clause shall \\\\nalso count as one of the allowable short pitched deliveries in that over. \\\\n41.6.1.8 In the event of a bowler bowling more than two fast short-pitched deliveries in an over as defined in \\\\nclause 41.6.1.5 above, the umpire at the bowler’s end shall call and signal No ball on each \\\\noccasion. A differential signal shall be used to signify a fast short pitched delivery. The umpire shall \\\\ncall and signal ‘No ball’ and then tap the head with the other hand. \\\\n41.6.1.9 If a bowler delivers a third fast short pitched ball in an over, the umpire, after the call of No ball and \\\\nwhen the ball is dead, shall caution the bowler, inform the other umpire, the captain of the fielding \\\\nside and the batters at the wicket of what has occurred. This caution shall apply throughout the \\\\ninnings. \\\\n41.6.1.10 If there is a second instance of the bowler being No balled in the innings for bowling more than two \\\\nfast short pitched deliveries in an over, the umpire shall advise the bowler that this is his final \\\\nwarning for the innings. \\\\n41.6.1.11 Should there be any further instance by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall \\\\n- call and signal No ball \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately \\\\nfrom bowling \\\\n- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any \\\\npart of the previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\n- The umpire shall inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting \\\\nside. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as \\\\nis considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.6.2 Should the umpires initiate the caution and warning procedures set out in clauses 41.6.1.3 and 41.7 such \\\\ncautions and warnings are not to be cumulative. \\\\n41.7 Bowling of dangerous and unfair non-pitching deliveries \\\\n41.7.1 Any delivery, which passes or would have passed, without pitching, above waist height of the striker \\\\nstanding upright at the popping crease, is to be deemed to be unfair, whether or not it is likely to inflict \\\\nphysical injury on the striker. If the bowler bowls such a delivery the umpire shall immediately call and signal \\\\nNo ball. \\\\nIf, in the opinion of the umpire, such a delivery is considered likely to inflict physical injury on the batter by its \\\\nspeed and direction, it shall be considered dangerous. When the ball is dead the umpire shall caution the \\\\nbowler, indicating that this is a first and final warning. The umpire shall also inform the other umpire, the \\\\ncaptain of the fielding side and the batters of what has occurred. This caution shall apply to that bowler \\\\nthroughout the innings. \\\\n \\\\n57 \\\\n41.7.2 Should there be any further instance (where a dangerous non-pitching delivery is bowled and is considered \\\\nlikely to inflict physical injury on the batter) by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall \\\\n- call and signal No ball \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from \\\\nbowling \\\\n- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the \\\\nprevious over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\nAdditionally the umpire shall \\\\n- report the occurrence to the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.7.3 The warning sequence in clauses 41.7.1 and 41.7.2 is independent of the warning and action sequence in \\\\nclause 41.6. \\\\n41.7.4 If the umpire considers that a bowler deliberately bowled a high full-pitched delivery, deemed to be \\\\ndangerous and unfair as defined in clause 41.7.1, then the caution and warning in clause 41.7.1 shall be \\\\ndispensed with. The umpire shall \\\\n- immediately call and signal No ball. \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from \\\\nbowling and inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the \\\\nprevious over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\n- report the occurrence to the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.8 Bowling of deliberate front-foot No ball \\\\nIf the umpire considers that the bowler has delivered a deliberate front-foot No ball, he/she shall \\\\n- immediately call and signal No ball. \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling \\\\n- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the previous \\\\nover, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\n- report the occurrence to the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n \\\\n58 \\\\n41.9 Time wasting by the fielding side \\\\n41.9.1 It is unfair for any fielder to waste time. \\\\n41.9.2 If either umpire considers that the progress of an over is unnecessarily slow, or time is being wasted in any \\\\nother way, by the captain of the fielding side or by any other fielder, at the first instance the umpire \\\\nconcerned shall \\\\n- if the ball is in play, call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of what has occurred. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- warn the captain of the fielding side, indicating that this is a first and final warning. \\\\n- inform the batters of what has occurred. \\\\n41.9.3 If either umpire considers that there is any further waste of time in that innings by any fielder, the umpire \\\\nconcerned shall \\\\n- if the ball is in play, call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of what has occurred. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side and inform the captain of the \\\\nfielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\nAdditionally the umpire shall inform the batters and, as soon as is practicable, the captain of the batting side \\\\nof what has occurred. \\\\nIf the umpires believe that the act of time wasting was deliberate or repetitive, they may lodge a report under \\\\nthe ICC Code of Conduct. In such circumstances the Captain and/or any individual members of the fielding \\\\nteam responsible for the time wasting will be charged. \\\\n41.9.4   The fielding side shall be ready to start each over within 60 seconds of the previous over being completed. \\\\n \\\\nAn electronic clock will be displayed at the ground that counts down seconds from 60 to zero.   \\\\n \\\\nThe clock is not required or, if already started, can be cancelled if: \\\\n \\\\n- A new batter comes to the wicket between overs \\\\n- An official drinks interval has been called \\\\n- The umpires have approved the onfield treatment of an injury to a batter or fielder (see Appendix H) \\\\n- The time lost is for any circumstances beyond the control of the fielding side \\\\n \\\\nThe third umpire is responsible for determining when to start the clock.  This should be the later of: \\\\n \\\\n- The ball becoming dead at the end of the previous over \\\\n- Any umpire or player review from the final ball of the previous over being completed. \\\\n \\\\nWhen the clock reaches zero, if the fielding side is not ready to start the next over: \\\\n \\\\n- On the first such occasion in an innings, the bowler’s end umpire shall issue a warning to the captain of the \\\\nfielding side and inform the batters and the other umpire of what has occurred. \\\\n- On the second occasion in an innings, the above sequence is repeated, but with the reminder that this is a \\\\nfinal warning. \\\\n- On the third and any subsequent occasion in an innings, the bowler’s end umpire shall award 5 Penalty runs \\\\nto the batting side, informing the captain of the fielding side, the batters and the other umpire. \\\\n \\\\nThe process, warnings and penalties in 41.9.4 operate independently of those of 41.9.2 and 41.9.3.   \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n59 \\\\nIf a fielding side is ready to resume play within the required time, but the batting side are not ready to do so, \\\\nthen the umpires shall determine, at their discretion, whether to apply the provisions of 41.10 (Batter wasting \\\\ntime). \\\\n41.10 Batter wasting time \\\\n41.10.1 It is unfair for a batter to waste time. In normal circumstances, the striker should always be ready to take \\\\nstrike when the bowler is ready to start his run-up. \\\\nIn addition, an incoming batter should be in position to take guard or his partner ready to receive the next \\\\nball within 2 minutes of the fall of the previous wicket. \\\\n41.10.2 Should either batter waste time by failing to meet this requirement, or in any other way, the following \\\\nprocedure shall be adopted. At the first instance, either before the bowler starts his run-up or when the ball \\\\nbecomes dead, as appropriate, the umpire shall \\\\n- warn both batters and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall apply throughout the \\\\ninnings. The umpire shall so inform each incoming batter. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of what has occurred. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what \\\\nhas occurred. \\\\n41.10.3 If there is any further time wasting by any batter in that innings, the umpire shall, at the appropriate time \\\\nwhile the ball is dead \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the other batter, the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the \\\\nbatting side of what has occurred. \\\\nIf the umpires believe that the act of time wasting was deemed to be deliberate or repetitive, they may lodge \\\\na report under the ICC Code of Conduct.

This caution shall apply to that \\\\nbowler throughout the innings. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and the batters of what has occurred. \\\\n41.13.3 If, in that innings, the same bowler again contravenes this clause, the umpire shall repeat the above \\\\nprocedure indicating that this is a final warning. This warning shall also apply throughout the innings. \\\\n41.13.4 If, in that innings, the same bowler contravenes this clause a third time, when the ball is dead, the umpire \\\\nshall, \\\\n- direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling. If applicable, the \\\\nover shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the previous over, nor \\\\nbe allowed to bowl any part of the next over. The bowler taken off shall not be allowed to bowl again in that \\\\ninnings. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.14 Batter damaging the pitch \\\\n41.14.1 It is unfair to cause deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch. If the striker enters the protected area in \\\\nplaying or playing at the ball, he must move from it immediately thereafter. A batter will be deemed to be \\\\ncausing avoidable damage if either umpire considers that his presence on the pitch is without reasonable \\\\ncause. \\\\n41.14.2 If either batter causes deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch, other than as in clause 41.15, at the first \\\\ninstance the umpire seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the \\\\noccurrence. The bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- warn both batters that the practice is unfair and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning \\\\nshall apply throughout the innings. The umpire shall so inform each incoming batter. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what \\\\nhas occurred. \\\\n41.14.3 If there is any further instance of deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch by any batter in that innings, \\\\nthe umpire seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the occurrence. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\\\n- return any not out batter to his original end \\\\n \\\\n61 \\\\n- signal No ball or Wide to the scorers if applicable. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. \\\\n- award any other 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective \\\\nhelmets belonging to the fielding side). \\\\n- Inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the \\\\nreason for this action. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the batter concerned. \\\\n41.15 Striker in protected area \\\\n41.15.1 The striker shall not adopt a batting position in the protected area or so close to it that frequent \\\\nencroachment is inevitable. \\\\nThe striker may make a mark on the pitch for the purpose of indicating his/her batting position provided that \\\\nno mark is unreasonably close to the protected area. \\\\n41.15.2 If either umpire considers that the striker is in breach of any of the conditions in clause 41.15.1, if the bowler \\\\nhas not entered the delivery stride, he/she shall immediately call Dead ball, otherwise, wait until the ball is \\\\ndead; he/she shall then inform the other umpire of the occurrence. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- warn the striker that the practice is unfair and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning \\\\nshall apply throughout the innings. The umpire shall so inform the non-striker and each incoming batter. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what \\\\nhas occurred. \\\\n41.15.3 If there is any further breach of any of the conditions in clause 41.15.1 by any batter in that innings, the \\\\numpire seeing the contravention shall, if the bowler has not entered his delivery stride, immediately call and \\\\nsignal Dead ball, otherwise, he/she shall wait until the ball is dead and then inform the other umpire of the \\\\noccurrence. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\\\n- return any not out batter to his original end \\\\n- signal No ball or Wide to the scorers if applicable. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. \\\\n- award any other 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective \\\\nhelmets belonging to the fielding side). \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the \\\\nreason for this action. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the batter concerned. \\\\n41.16 Batters stealing a run \\\\n41.16.1 It is unfair for the batters to attempt to steal a run during the bowler’s run-up. \\\\nUnless the bowler attempts to run out the non-striker – see clause 38.3 (Non-striker leaving his/her ground \\\\nearly) – the umpire shall \\\\n \\\\n62 \\\\n- call and signal Dead ball as soon as the batters cross in such an attempt. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- return the batters to their original ends and disallow the attempted run. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. \\\\n-  award any other 5 run Penalty that is applicable \\\\n- inform the batters, the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting \\\\nside, of the reason for this action. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the batter concerned. \\\\n41.17 Penalty runs \\\\n41.17.1 When Penalty runs are awarded to either side, when the ball is dead the umpire shall signal the Penalty runs \\\\nto the scorers. See clause 2.13 (Signals). \\\\n41.17.2 Penalty runs shall be awarded in each case where these Playing Conditions require the award, even if a \\\\nresult has already been achieved.

If the fielding side has not completed an innings, the 5 Penalty runs shall be \\\\nadded to the score in its next innings. \\\\n42 PLAYERS’ CONDUCT \\\\n42.1 Serious misconduct \\\\n42.1.1 The umpires shall act upon any serious misconduct. The relevant offences and the corresponding actions by \\\\nthe umpires are identified in clause 42.2.1. These offences correspond with Level 4 offences in the ICC \\\\nCode of Conduct. Level 1 to Level 3 offences continue to be dealt with separately under the ICC Code of \\\\nConduct. \\\\n42.1.2 If either umpire considers that a player has committed one of these offences at any time during the match, \\\\nthe umpire concerned shall call and signal Dead ball. This call may be delayed until the umpire is satisfied \\\\nthat it will not disadvantage the non-offending side. \\\\n42.1.3 The umpire concerned shall report the matter to the other umpire and together they shall decide whether an \\\\noffence has been committed. The umpires may also consult with the third umpire and the match referee, \\\\n \\\\n63 \\\\nwho may review any audio or video replays to confirm whether an offence has been committed. If so, the \\\\numpires shall then apply the related sanctions. \\\\n42.1.4 Any call of No ball or Wide before the offence shall stand \\\\n42.1.5 If the offence is committed by a batter, the umpires shall summon the offending player’s captain to the field. \\\\nSolely for the purpose of this clause, the batters at the wicket may not deputise for their captain. \\\\n42.2 Level 4 offences and action by umpires \\\\n42.2.1 Any of the following actions by a player shall constitute a Level 4 offence: \\\\n- threatening to assault an umpire \\\\n- making inappropriate and deliberate physical contact with an umpire \\\\n- physically assaulting a player or any other person \\\\n- committing any other act of violence. \\\\n42.2.2 If such an offence is committed, 42.2.2.1 to 42.2.2.5 shall be implemented. \\\\n42.2.2.1 The umpire shall call Time. \\\\n42.2.2.2 Together the umpires shall summon and inform the offending player’s captain that an offence at this \\\\nLevel has occurred. \\\\n42.2.2.3 The umpires shall instruct the captain to remove the offending player immediately from the field of \\\\nplay for the remainder of the match and shall apply the following: \\\\n42.2.2.3.1 If the offending player is a fielder, no substitute shall be allowed for him. He is to be recorded as Retired \\\\n– out at the commencement of any subsequent innings in which his team is the batting side. \\\\n42.2.2.3.2 If a bowler is suspended mid-over, then that over must be completed by a different bowler, who shall not \\\\nhave bowled the previous over nor shall be permitted to bowl the next over. \\\\n42.2.2.3.3 If the offending player is a batter he is to be recorded as Retired – out in the current innings, unless he \\\\nhas been dismissed under any of clauses 32 to 39, and at the commencement of any subsequent \\\\ninnings in which his team is the batting side. If no further batter is available to bat, the innings is \\\\ncompleted. \\\\n42.2.2.4 As soon as practicable, the umpire shall: \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing team \\\\n- signal the Level 4 penalty to the scorers \\\\n- call Play. \\\\n42.2.2.5 The umpires shall then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee under the ICC Code of Conduct. \\\\n42.3 Captain refusing to remove a player from the field \\\\n42.3.1 If a captain refuses to carry out an instruction under 42.2.2.3, the umpires shall invoke clause 16.2 (ICC \\\\nMatch Referee awarding a match). \\\\n42.3.2 If both captains refuse to carry out instructions under 42.2.2.3 in respect of the same incident, the umpires \\\\nshall instruct the players to leave the field. The match is not concluded as in clause 12.6 and there shall be \\\\nno result under clause 16. \\\\n42.4 Additional points relating to Level 4 offences \\\\n42.4.1 If a player, while acting as wicket-keeper, commits a Level 4 offence, clause 24.1.2 shall not apply, meaning \\\\nthat only a nominated player may keep wicket, even if another fielder becomes injured or ill and is replaced \\\\nby a substitute. \\\\n42.4.2 A nominated player who has a substitute will also suffer the penalty for any Level 4 offence committed by \\\\nthe substitute. However, only the substitute will be reported under clause 42.2.2.5. \\\\n \\\\n64 \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n65 \\\\nAppendices to ICC Men’s Standard ODI Playing Conditions \\\\n \\\\nA. Definitions \\\\nB.

Similarly the umpires always means both umpires \\\\nand the third umpire.  An umpire and umpires are generalised terms.  \\\\nOtherwise, a fuller description indicates which one of the umpires is \\\\nspecifically intended.  Each umpire will be bowler’s end umpire and striker’s \\\\nend umpire in alternate overs.  \\\\n5.2 Bowler’s end umpire is the umpire who is standing at the bowler’s end (see \\\\nparagraph 4.4) for the current delivery. \\\\n5.3 Striker’s end umpire is the umpire who is standing at the striker’s end (see \\\\nparagraph 4.3), to one side of the pitch or the other, depending on his/her \\\\nchoice, for the current delivery.     \\\\n5.4 On-field umpires shall mean, collectively, the bowler’s end umpire and the \\\\nstriker’s end umpire. \\\\n5.5 Third umpire is the umpire who may use television evidence and other \\\\navailable technology in order review a decision of the on-field umpires, either \\\\nby way of an Umpire Review or a Player Review under the protocol set out in \\\\nAppendix D.

This definition includes not only both the bowler and \\\\n \\\\n70 \\\\nthe wicket-keeper but also nominated players who are legitimately on the field \\\\nof play, together with players legitimately acting as substitutes for absent \\\\nnominated players.  It excludes any nominated player who is absent from the \\\\nfield of play, or who has been absent from the field of play and who has not yet \\\\nobtained the umpire’s permission to return.  \\\\nA player going briefly outside the boundary in the course of discharging his duties as a fielder is not absent \\\\nfrom the field of play nor, for the purposes of clause 24.2 (Fielder absent or leaving the field of play), is he to \\\\nbe regarded as having left the field of play. \\\\n8 Substitutes and Concussion Replacements \\\\n8.1 A Substitute is a player who takes the place of a fielder on the field of play, \\\\nbut does not replace the player for whom he substitutes on that side’s list of \\\\nnominated players.

If the return crease is on the same side as \\\\nhis bowling arm, he is bowling round the wicket. \\\\n9.2 Delivery swing is the motion of the bowler’s arm during which he normally \\\\nreleases the ball for a delivery. \\\\n9.3 Delivery stride is the stride during which the delivery swing is made, whether \\\\nthe ball is released or not.  It starts when the bowler’s back foot lands for that \\\\nstride and ends when the front foot lands in the same stride.  The stride after \\\\nthe delivery stride is completed when the next foot lands, i.e. when the back \\\\nfoot of the delivery stride lands again. \\\\n9.4 The Illegal Bowling Regulations are the ICC’s regulations governing Illegal \\\\nBowling Actions. \\\\n9.5 An Illegal Bowling Action is a bowling action where a bowler’s Elbow \\\\nExtension exceeds 15 degrees, measured from the point at which the bowling \\\\narm reaches the horizontal until the point at which the ball is released (any \\\\nElbow Hyperextension shall be discounted for the purposes of determining an \\\\nIllegal Bowling Action). \\\\n9.6 Elbow Extension means the motion that occurs when a bowler\\'s arm moves \\\\nfrom a flexed (bent) position at the elbow, to a more extended (straight) \\\\nposition (full Elbow Extension occurs when the arm is straight). \\\\n9.7 Elbow Hyperextension is the motion that occurs when a bowler\\'s elbow \\\\nextends beyond the straight position. \\\\n \\\\n71 \\\\n9.8 The ICC Bowling Action Report Form is the form provided for by Article 3 of \\\\nthe Illegal Bowling Regulations, by which an umpire and/or the ICC Match \\\\nReferee may submit a report relating to a suspected Illegal Bowling Action. \\\\n10 The ball \\\\n10.1 The ball is struck/strikes the ball unless specifically defined otherwise, \\\\nmean ‘the ball is struck by the bat’/‘strikes the ball with the bat’. \\\\n10.2 Full-pitch describes a ball delivered by the bowler that reaches or passes the \\\\nstriker without having touched the ground.  Sometimes described as non-\\\\npitching. \\\\n11 Runs \\\\n11.1 A run to be disallowed is one that in these Playing Conditions should not \\\\nhave been taken.  It is not only to be cancelled but the batters are to be \\\\nreturned to their original ends.   \\\\n11.2 A run not to be scored is one that is not illegal, but is not recognised as a \\\\nproperly executed run.  It is not a run that has been made, so the question of \\\\ncancellation does not arise.  The loss of the run so attempted is not a \\\\ndisallowance and the batters will not be returned to their original ends on that \\\\naccount.  \\\\n12 The person \\\\n12.1 Person; A player’s person is his physical person (flesh and blood) together \\\\nwith any clothing or legitimate external protective equipment that he is wearing \\\\nexcept, in the case of a batter, his bat. \\\\nA hand, whether gloved or not, that is not holding the bat is part of the batter’s person. \\\\nNo item of clothing or equipment is part of the player’s person unless it is attached to him. \\\\nFor a batter, a glove being held but not worn is part of his person. \\\\nFor a fielder, an item of clothing or equipment he is holding in his hand or hands is not part of his person. \\\\n12.2 Clothing – anything that a player is wearing, including such items as \\\\nspectacles or jewellery, that is not classed as external protective equipment is \\\\nclassed as clothing, even though he may be wearing some items of apparel, \\\\nwhich are not visible, for protection.  A bat being carried by a batter does not \\\\ncome within this definition of clothing. \\\\n12.3 Hand for batter or wicket-keeper shall include both the hand itself and the \\\\nwhole of a glove worn on the hand. \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n72 \\\\n13 Off side / on side; in front of / behind the popping crease. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n73 \\\\nAppendix B  \\\\n \\\\nEquipment  \\\\n1 The Bat \\\\n1.1 General guidance \\\\n1.1.1 Measurements - All provisions in paragraphs 1.2 to 1.6 below are subject to the measurements and \\\\nrestrictions stated in the Playing Conditions and this Appendix. \\\\n1.1.2 Adhesives – Throughout, adhesives are permitted only where essential and only in minimal quantity. \\\\n1.2 Specifications for the Handle \\\\n1.2.1 One end of the handle is inserted into a recess in the blade as a means of joining the handle and the blade. \\\\nThis lower portion is used purely for joining the blade and the handle together.  It is not part of the blade but, \\\\nsolely in interpreting paragraphs 1.3 and 1.4 below, references to the blade shall be considered to extend \\\\nalso to this lower portion of the handle where relevant. \\\\n1.2.2 The handle may be glued where necessary and bound with twine along the upper portion.  \\\\nProviding clause 5.5 is not contravened, the upper portion may be covered with materials solely to provide a \\\\nsurface suitable for gripping.  Such covering is an addition and is not part of the bat, except in relation to \\\\nclause 5.6.  The bottom of this grip should not extend below the point defined in paragraph 1.2.4 below. \\\\nTwine binding and the covering grip may extend beyond the junction of the upper and lower portions of the \\\\nhandle, to cover part of the shoulders of the bat as defined in paragraph 1.3.1. \\\\nNo material may be placed on or inserted into the lower portion of the handle other than as permitted above \\\\ntogether with the minimal adhesives or adhesive tape used solely for fixing these items, or for fixing the \\\\nhandle to the blade. \\\\n1.2.3 Materials in handle – As a proportion of the total volume of the handle, materials other than cane, wood or \\\\ntwine are restricted to one-tenth. Such materials must not project more than 3.25 in/8.26 cm into the lower \\\\nportion of the handle \\\\n1.2.4 Binding and covering of handle – The permitted continuation beyond the junction of the upper and lower \\\\nportions of the handle is restricted to a maximum, measured along the length of the handle, of \\\\n2.5 in/6.35 cm in for the twine binding \\\\n2.75 in/6.99 cm for the covering grip. \\\\n1.3 Specifications for the Blade \\\\n1.3.1 The blade has a face, a back, a toe, sides and shoulders \\\\n1.3.1.1 The face of the blade is its main striking surface and shall be flat or have a slight convex curve \\\\nresulting from traditional pressing techniques.  The back is the opposite surface. \\\\n1.3.1.2 The shoulders, sides and toe are the remaining surfaces, separating the face and the back. \\\\n1.3.1.3 The shoulders, one on each side of the handle, are along that portion of the blade between the first \\\\nentry point of the handle and the point at which the blade first reaches its full width. \\\\n1.3.1.4 The toe is the surface opposite to the shoulders taken as a pair. \\\\n1.3.1.5 The sides, one each side of the blade, are along the rest of the blade, between the toe and the \\\\nshoulders. \\\\n \\\\n74 \\\\n1.3.2 No material may be placed on or inserted into the blade other than as permitted in paragraph 1.2.4, \\\\nparagraph 1.3.3, and clause 5.4 together with the minimal adhesives or adhesive tape used solely for fixing \\\\nthese items, or for fixing the handle to the blade. \\\\n1.3.3 Covering the blade. Bats shall have no covering on the blade except as permitted in clause 5.4.   \\\\nAny materials referred to above, in clause 5.4 and paragraph 1.4 below, are to be considered as part of the \\\\nbat, which must still pass through the gauge as defined in paragraph 1.6. \\\\n1.4 Protection and repair  \\\\n1.4.1 The surface of the blade may be treated with non-solid materials to improve resistance to moisture \\\\npenetration and/or mask natural blemishes in the appearance of the wood.  Save for the purpose of giving a \\\\nhomogeneous appearance by masking natural blemishes, such treatment shall not materially alter the colour \\\\nof the blade.  \\\\n1.4.2 Materials can be used for protection and repair as stated in clause 5.4 and are additional to the blade. Note \\\\nhowever clause 5.6. \\\\nAny such material shall not extend over any part of the back of the blade except in the case of clause 5.4.1 \\\\nand then only when it is applied as a continuous wrapping covering the damaged area. \\\\nThe repair material shall not extend along the length of the blade more than 0.79 in/2.0 cm in each direction \\\\nbeyond the limits of the damaged area.  Where used as a continuous binding, any overlapping shall not \\\\nbreach the maximum of 0.04 in/0.1 cm in total thickness. \\\\nThe use of non-solid material which when dry forms a hard layer more than 0.004 in/0.01 cm in thickness is \\\\nnot permitted. \\\\n1.4.3 Permitted coverings, repair material and toe guards, not exceeding their specified thicknesses, may be \\\\nadditional to the dimensions above, but the bat must still pass through the gauge as described in paragraph \\\\n1.6. \\\\n1.5 Commercial identifications  \\\\nSuch identifications shall comply with the restrictions set out in the Clothing and Equipment Regulations in \\\\nrelation to the size and position of marks and logos. \\\\n1.6 Bat Gauge \\\\nAll bats must meet the specifications defined in clause 5.7. They must also, with or without protective \\\\ncoverings permitted in clause 5.4, be able to pass through a bat gauge, the dimensions and shape of which \\\\nare shown in the following diagram: \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n75 \\\\n2 The wickets \\\\n \\\\n2.1 Bails \\\\nOverall 4.31 in / 10.95 cm \\\\na = 1.38 in / 3.50 cm \\\\nb = 2.13 in / 5.40 cm \\\\nc = 0.81 in / 2.06 cm \\\\n2.2 Stumps \\\\nHeight (d) = 28 in / 71.1 cm \\\\nDiameter (e) - maximum = 1.5 in / 3.81 cm; minimum = 1.38 in / 3.50 cm \\\\n2.3 Overall \\\\nWidth (f) of wicket 9 in / 22.86 cm \\\\n3 Wicket-keeping gloves \\\\n3.1 The images below illustrate the requirements of clause 27.2 \\\\nin relation to: \\\\n• no webbing between the fingers; \\\\n• a single piece of non-stretch material between finger and thumb as a means of support; and \\\\n• when a hand wearing the glove has the thumb fully extended, the top edge being taut and not \\\\nprotruding beyond the straight line joining the top of the index finger to the top of the thumb. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n76 \\\\n  \\\\n3.2 Note also the requirement for wicket-keeping gloves to comply with the \\\\nClothing and Equipment Regulations in relation to the size and position of \\\\nmarks and logos. \\\\n4 Helmets and Neck Protectors \\\\n \\\\n4.1     Players must wear a helmet in the following circumstances where: \\\\n- batters are facing pace bowlers, \\\\n- wicket keepers are standing up to the stumps, and \\\\n- fielding close to the batter in front of the wicket \\\\n4.2     All helmets must be certified (BS7928:2013) helmets. \\\\n4.3     At other times helmets are optional.  However, if a helmet is worn, it also must be a certified  \\\\n(BS7928:2013) helmet. \\\\n4.4     The use of a neck protector when batting in International Cricket is optional. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n77 \\\\nAppendix C  \\\\n \\\\nThe Venue  \\\\n1 The pitch and the creases \\\\n \\\\n2 Restriction on the placement of fielders \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n78 \\\\n3 Advertising on grounds, perimeter boards and sight-\\\\nscreens \\\\n3.1 Advertising on grounds \\\\n3.1.1 The logos on outfields are to be positioned as follows:   \\\\n(a) Behind the stumps – a minimum of 25.15 yards (23 meters) from the stumps.   \\\\n(b) Midwicket/cover area – no advertising to be positioned within 30 yards (27.50 meters) of the centre \\\\nof the pitch being used for the match.    \\\\n3.1.2 Note: Advertising closer to the stumps as set out above which is required to meet 3D requirements for \\\\nbroadcasters may be permitted, subject to prior ICC approval having been obtained.  \\\\n3.2 Perimeter boards \\\\n3.2.1 Advertising on perimeter boards placed in front of the sight-screens is permitted save that the predominant \\\\ncolour of such advertising shall be of a contrasting colour to that of the ball.  \\\\n3.2.2 Advertising on perimeter boards behind the stumps at both ends shall not contain moving, flashing or \\\\nflickering images and operators should ensure that the images are only changed or moved at a time that will \\\\nnot be distracting to the players or the umpires.    \\\\n3.2.3 The brightness of any electronic images shall be set at a level so that it is not a distraction to the players or \\\\numpires. \\\\n3.3 Sight-screens   \\\\n3.3.1 Sight-screens shall be provided at both ends of all grounds. \\\\n3.3.2 Advertising shall be permitted on the sight-screen behind the striker, providing it is removed for the \\\\nsubsequent over from that end. \\\\n3.3.3 Such advertising shall not contain flashing or flickering images and particular care should be taken by the \\\\noperators that the advertising is not changed at a time which is distracting to the umpire. \\\\n4 Markings on outfield \\\\nWith the permission of the Ground Authority, a bowler may use paint to make a small marking on the outfield \\\\nfor the purposes of identifying their run-up. Paint used for this purpose shall be any colour other than white. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n79 \\\\nAppendix D  \\\\nDecision Review System (DRS) and Third Umpire Protocol  \\\\n1 General \\\\nMinimum requirements for use of DRS and appointment of third umpire \\\\n1.1.1 Save with the express written consent of the ICC General Manager - Cricket, the Home Board shall ensure \\\\nthe live television broadcast of all ODI matches played in its country. \\\\n1.1.2 Where matches are broadcast, the camera specification set out below shall be mandatory as a minimum \\\\nrequirement. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n1.1.3 Where the camera specification set out above is provided, a third umpire shall be appointed to the match. \\\\n1.1.4 The provisions of paragraphs 1.1.1, 1.1.2, and 1.1.3 above shall not apply for matches between a Full \\\\nMember country and Associate Member countries (whose matches have been granted ODI status) and for \\\\nmatches between such Associate Member countries. \\\\n1.1.5 If the minimum requirements for DRS to be used are satisfied, both participating Boards may agree to \\\\nemploy the DRS for an ODI. Otherwise, the third umpire shall be appointed and empowered to use \\\\nbroadcast replays to make decisions that are referred to him/her in accordance with paragraph 2 (Umpire \\\\nReviews). \\\\n1.1.6 The table below summarises the minimum requirements for DRS to be used, and the regulations around the \\\\nappointment of the third umpire: \\\\n Third Umpire (non-DRS) DRS \\\\nMinimum \\\\nRequirement \\\\nCameras Specification detailed in paragraph  \\\\n1.1.2  \\\\nCameras \\\\n- Specification detailed in \\\\nparagraph 1.1.2 \\\\nTechnology \\\\n- Approved ball-tracking \\\\ntechnology. \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n80 \\\\n- Approved sound-based \\\\nedge detection \\\\ntechnology. \\\\nThird Umpire \\\\nAppointment \\\\nAppointed by Home Board. From the home \\\\ncountry. From ICC Elite Panel or \\\\nInternational Panel of umpires. \\\\nAppointed by the ICC. Not from \\\\nthe same country as \\\\neither of the participating \\\\nteams. From ICC Elite \\\\nPanel or International \\\\nPanel of umpires. \\\\nThird Umpire \\\\nJurisdiction \\\\nUmpire Reviews only Umpire Reviews and Player \\\\nReviews \\\\nReplays that can \\\\nbe used \\\\nThe third umpire shall only have access to \\\\nreplays of any camera images. Other \\\\ntechnology which may be in use by the \\\\nbroadcaster for broadcast purposes \\\\n(for example, ball-tracking technology, \\\\nsound-based edge detection \\\\ntechnology, and heat-based edge \\\\ndetection technology) shall not be used \\\\nduring Umpire Reviews. \\\\nAny replay, stump microphone \\\\naudio or technology \\\\ndetailed in paragraph \\\\n3.8.1 below. \\\\nICC Technical \\\\nOfficer \\\\nNot required. The ICC shall appoint an \\\\nindependent technology \\\\nexpert (ICC Technical \\\\nOfficer) to be present at \\\\nevery series in which the \\\\nDRS is used to assist the \\\\nthird umpire and to \\\\nprotect the integrity of \\\\nthe DRS process. \\\\n \\\\n81 \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n1.1.7 The Home Board shall ensure that a separate room is provided for the third umpire and that he/she has \\\\naccess to the television equipment and technology  so as to be in the best position to facilitate the referral \\\\nand/or consultation processes referred to in paragraphs 2 (Umpire Review) and 3 (Player Review) below. \\\\n2 Umpire Review \\\\nIn the circumstances detailed in paragraphs 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 below, the on-field umpire shall have the \\\\ndiscretion to refer the decision to the third umpire or, in the case of paragraphs 2.2, and 2.4, to consult with \\\\nthe third umpire before making the decision. In line with clause 21.5, the third umpire shall already have \\\\nreviewed television replays of the bowler’s feet landing and, where satisfied that not all the requirements \\\\nhave been met, shall immediately have advised the bowler’s end umpire (who shall in turn have immediately \\\\ncalled and signalled No ball). Accordingly, paragraphs 2 (Umpire Review) and 3 (Player Review) of this \\\\nAppendix D shall operate on the basis that this element of the referral and/or consultation process has \\\\nalready been undertaken. \\\\nSave for requesting the umpire to review his/her decision under paragraph 3 (Player Review) below, players \\\\nmay not appeal to the on-field umpires to use the Umpire Review. Breach of this provision may constitute \\\\ndissent and the player may be subject to disciplinary action under the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and \\\\nPlayer Support Personnel. \\\\n2.1 Run Out, Stumped, Bowled and Hit Wicket Decisions \\\\n2.1.1 The relevant on-field umpire shall be entitled to refer an appeal for run-out, stumped, bowled or hit wicket to \\\\nthe third umpire. \\\\n2.1.2 An on-field umpire wishing to refer a decision to the third umpire shall signal to the third umpire by making \\\\nthe shape of a TV screen with his/her hands. \\\\n2.1.3 In the case of a referral of a bowled, hit wicket or stumped decision, the third umpire shall first check the \\\\nfairness of the delivery (any mode of No ball on request except for (i) in respect of the feet, which shall \\\\nalready have been checked in accordance with clause 21.5; and (ii) the bowler using an Illegal Bowling \\\\nAction, subject to the proviso that the third umpire may review whether the bowler has used a prohibited \\\\nSpecific Variation under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations). If the delivery was not a fair delivery \\\\nthe third umpire shall indicate that the batter is Not out and advise the on-field umpire to signal No ball. See \\\\nalso paragraph 2.3.4 below. \\\\n2.1.4 Additionally, if on review of a run out, bowled or hit wicket, the third umpire finds the batter is Out by another \\\\nmode of dismissal (excluding LBW), or Not out by any mode of dismissal (excluding LBW), he/she shall \\\\nnotify the on-field umpire so that the correct decision is made. \\\\n2.1.5 If the third umpire decides that the batter is Out, a red light shall be displayed; if the third umpire decides that \\\\nthe batter is Not out, a green light shall be displayed. Should the third umpire be temporarily unable to \\\\nrespond, a white light (where available) shall remain illuminated throughout the period of interruption to \\\\nsignify to the on-field umpires that Umpire Reviews are temporarily unavailable, in which case the decision \\\\nshall be taken by the on-field umpire. As an alternative to the red/green light system, the replay screen \\\\n(where available) may be used for the purpose of conveying the third umpire’s decision, in line with the ICC \\\\nBig Screen Policy. \\\\n2.2 Caught Decisions, Obstructing the Field \\\\n2.2.1 Where the bowler’s end umpire is unable to decide upon a Fair Catch or a Bump Ball, or if, on appeal from \\\\nthe fielding side, the batter obstructed the field, he/she shall first consult with the striker’s end umpire. \\\\n2.2.2 Should both on-field umpires require assistance from the third umpire to make a decision, the bowler’s end \\\\numpire shall consult by two-way radio with the third umpire followed by making the shape of a TV screen \\\\nwith his/her hands.  \\\\n \\\\n82 \\\\n2.2.3 The third umpire shall determine whether the batter has been caught, whether the delivery was a Bump Ball, \\\\nor if the batter obstructed the field. However, in reviewing the television replay(s), the third umpire shall first \\\\ncheck the fairness of the delivery for all decisions involving a catch (any mode of No ball, on request, except \\\\nfor (i) in respect of the  feet, which shall already have been checked in accordance with clause 21.5; and (ii) \\\\nthe bowler using an Illegal Bowling Action, subject to the proviso that the third umpire may review whether \\\\nthe bowler has used a prohibited Specific Variation under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations) and \\\\nwhether the batter has hit the ball. If the delivery was not a fair delivery he/she shall advise the bowler’s end \\\\numpire to signal No ball. See also paragraph 2.6 below. Additionally, if it is clear to the third umpire that the \\\\nbatter is Out by another mode of dismissal (excluding LBW), or Not out by any mode of dismissal (excluding \\\\nLBW), he/she shall notify the bowler’s end umpire of his/her decision, which will then be displayed on the big \\\\nscreen. \\\\n2.2.4 The third umpire shall communicate his/her decision as set out in paragraph 2.1.5. \\\\n2.3 Boundary Decisions \\\\n2.3.1 The bowler’s end umpire shall be entitled to refer to the third umpire for a decision on: \\\\n2.3.1.1 whether a four or six has been scored; \\\\n2.3.1.2 whether a fielder had any part of his person in contact with the ball when he touched the boundary; \\\\nor \\\\n2.3.1.3 whether the fielder had any part of his person in contact with the ball when he had any part of his \\\\nperson grounded beyond the boundary. \\\\n2.3.1.4 the number of runs scored when a boundary results from an overthrow or the wilful act of a fielder \\\\n(see clause 19.8) \\\\n2.3.2 A decision shall be made immediately and cannot be changed thereafter. \\\\n2.3.3 If the television evidence is inconclusive as to whether or not a boundary has been scored, the default \\\\npresumption shall be in favour of no boundary being awarded. \\\\n2.3.4 Where the bowler’s end umpire wishes to use the assistance of the third umpire in this circumstance, he/she \\\\nshall communicate with the third umpire by use of a two-way radio and the third umpire shall convey his \\\\ndecision to the bowler’s end umpire by the same method. \\\\n2.3.5 The third umpire may initiate contact with the on-field umpire by two-way radio if TV coverage shows a \\\\nboundary line infringement or incident that appears not to have been acted upon by the on-field umpires. \\\\n2.4 Batters Running to the Same End \\\\n2.4.1 Where both batters have run to the same end and the on-field umpires are uncertain over which batter made \\\\nhis ground first, the on-field umpires may consult with the third umpire. \\\\n2.4.2 The procedure set out in paragraph 2.3.4 shall apply. \\\\n2.5 Short run \\\\n2.5.1 The third umpire shall automatically review any call of Short run by an on-field umpire under clauses 18.3 \\\\nand 18.4, communicating with the relevant on-field umpire by two-way radio and conveying his/her decision \\\\nby the same method. \\\\n2.6 No Balls \\\\n2.6.1 If the bowler’s end umpire is uncertain as to the fairness of the delivery following a dismissal (other than in \\\\nrespect of the  feet, which shall have already been checked by the third umpire), either affecting the validity \\\\nof the dismissal or which batter is dismissed, other than in respect of clause 21.5 (Fair delivery – the feet) for \\\\nwhich the third umpire will already have checked, he/she shall be entitled to request the batter to delay \\\\nleaving the field and to check the fairness of the delivery with the third umpire. Communication with the third \\\\numpire shall be by two-way radio. \\\\n \\\\n83 \\\\n2.6.2 The third umpire shall check any mode of No ball on request (other than in respect of the  feet, which shall \\\\nhave already been checked) not already checked except for the bowler using an Illegal Bowling Action \\\\n(subject to the proviso that the third umpire may review whether the bowler has used a prohibited Specific \\\\nVariation under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations).  \\\\n2.6.3 If the delivery was not a fair delivery, the bowler’s end umpire shall indicate that the batter is Not out and \\\\nsignal No ball (except in the case of a dismissal for obstructing the field, which may still be effected despite a \\\\nNo ball being called, in which case the bowler’s end umpire shall indicate that the relevant batter is Out and \\\\nadditionally call a No ball). \\\\n2.6.4 If a No ball under clause 21.5, after being reviewed by the third umpire, is only called by the bowler’s end \\\\numpire after the ball is dead,  the batting side shall benefit from the reversal of the dismissal and the one run \\\\nfor the No ball, but shall not benefit from any runs that may subsequently have accrued from the delivery \\\\nhad the on-field umpire originally called a No ball prior to the ball becoming dead. Where the batters crossed \\\\nwhile the ball was in the air before being caught, the batters shall return to their original ends as if the striker \\\\nhad been dismissed, but no runs shall be credited to the striker even if one (or more) runs were completed \\\\nprior to the catch being taken. \\\\n2.7 Cameras On or Over the Field of Play \\\\n2.7.1 The on-field umpires shall be entitled to refer to the third umpire for a decision as to whether the ball has at \\\\nany time during the normal course of play come into contact with any part of the camera, its apparatus or its \\\\ncables above the playing area, as contemplated in clause 20.1.3. \\\\n2.7.2 Where an on-field umpire wishes to use the assistance of the third umpire in this circumstance, he/she shall \\\\ncommunicate with the third umpire by use of a two-way radio and the third umpire shall convey his/her \\\\ndecision to the bowler’s end umpire by the same method. \\\\n2.7.3 A decision shall be made immediately and cannot be changed thereafter. If the television evidence is \\\\ninconclusive as to whether or not the ball has come into contact with any part of the camera, its apparatus or \\\\nits cables above the playing area, the default presumption shall be in favour of no contact having been \\\\nmade. \\\\n2.7.4 The third umpire may initiate contact with the on-field umpire by two-way radio if TV coverage shows the ball \\\\nto have been in contact with any part of the camera or its cables above the playing area as envisaged under \\\\nthis paragraph. \\\\n3 Player Review \\\\nThe following paragraphs shall operate in addition to and in conjunction with paragraph 2 (Umpire Review). \\\\n3.1 Circumstances in which a Player Review may be requested \\\\n3.1.1 A player may request a review of any decision taken by the on-field umpires concerning whether or not a \\\\nbatter is dismissed, with the exception of ‘Timed Out’ (Player Review). \\\\n3.1.2 No other decisions made by the umpires are eligible for a Player Review. \\\\n3.1.3 Only the batter involved in a dismissal may request a Player Review of an Out decision and only the captain \\\\n(or acting captain) of the fielding team may request a Player Review of a Not out decision. \\\\n3.1.4 A decision concerning whether or not a batter is dismissed that could have been the subject of a Umpire \\\\nReview under paragraph 2 is eligible for a Player Review as soon as it is clear that the on-field umpire has \\\\nchosen not to initiate the Umpire Review. \\\\n3.2 The manner of requesting the Player Review \\\\n3.2.1 The request shall be made by the player making a ‘T’ sign with both forearms at head height. \\\\n3.2.2 The total time elapsed between the ball becoming dead and the review request being made shall be no \\\\nmore than 15 seconds. The bowler’s end umpire shall provide the relevant player with a prompt after 10 \\\\nseconds if the request has not been made at that time and the player shall request the review immediately \\\\n \\\\n84 \\\\nthereafter. If the on-field umpires believe that a request has not been made within the 15 second time limit, \\\\nthey shall decline the request for a Player Review. \\\\n3.2.3 The captain may consult with the bowler and other fielders, and the two batters may consult with each other \\\\nprior to deciding whether to request a Player Review. Either the captain or the two batters may, in respect of \\\\na decision relating to an appeal for LBW, question the bowler’s end umpire as to whether his/her decision \\\\nhas been made on the basis that the striker made no genuine attempt to play the ball with the bat. Under no \\\\nother circumstances is any player permitted to query an umpire about any aspect of a decision before \\\\ndeciding on whether or not to request a Player Review. If the on-field umpires believe that the captain or \\\\neither batter has received direct or indirect input emanating other than from the players on the field, then \\\\nthey may at their discretion decline the request for a Player Review. In particular, signals from the dressing \\\\nroom must not be given. \\\\n3.2.4 No replays, either at normal speed or slow motion, shall be shown on a big screen to spectators until the 15 \\\\nsecond time limit allowed for requesting a Player Review has elapsed. \\\\n3.2.5 Where either on-field umpire initiates an Umpire Review, this does not preclude a player seeking a Player \\\\nReview of a separate incident from the same delivery. The request for a Player Review may be made after \\\\nthe Umpire Review, provided the request is still within the 15 second time limit described in paragraph 3.2.2 \\\\nabove. (See paragraphs 3.9.2 and 3.9.3 below for the process for addressing both an Umpire and Player \\\\nReview). \\\\n3.2.6 A request for a Player Review cannot be withdrawn once it has been made. \\\\n3.3 The process of consultation \\\\n3.3.1 On receipt of an eligible and timely request for a Player Review, the relevant on-field umpire shall make the \\\\nsign of a shape of a TV screen with his/her hands in the normal way. \\\\n3.3.2 The relevant on-field umpire shall initiate communication with the third umpire by confirming; \\\\n3.3.2.1 That a Player Review has been requested, \\\\n3.3.2.2 The mode of dismissal for which the relevant on-field umpire adjudicated the appeal, \\\\n3.3.2.3 The decision that has been made (Out or Not out), and; \\\\n3.3.2.4 For LBW appeals, where relevant, if the bowler’s end umpire believed that the striker made no \\\\ngenuine attempt to play the ball with the bat (the default presumption of the third umpire in the \\\\nabsence of any information on this point from the bowler’s end umpire shall be that a genuine \\\\nattempt to play the ball with the bat was made). \\\\n3.3.3 A two-way consultation process shall begin to investigate whether there is anything that the third umpire can \\\\nsee or hear which would indicate that the on-field umpire should change his/her original decision. \\\\n3.3.4 The third umpire shall not withhold any factual information which may help in the decision making process. \\\\nIn particular, in reviewing a dismissal, if the third umpire believes that the batter may instead be Out by any \\\\nother mode of dismissal, he/she shall advise the on-field umpire accordingly. The process of consultation \\\\ndescribed in this paragraph in respect of such other mode of dismissal shall then be conducted as if the \\\\nbatter has been given Not out. \\\\n3.3.5 The third umpire shall initially check all modes of No ball except for the bowler using an Illegal Bowling \\\\nAction (subject to the proviso that the third umpire may review whether the bowler has used a prohibited \\\\nSpecific Variation under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations), where appropriate advising the on-\\\\nfield umpire accordingly. \\\\n3.3.6 If despite the available technology, the third umpire is unable to decide with a high degree of confidence \\\\nwhether the original on-field decision should be changed, then he/she shall report that the replays are \\\\n‘inconclusive’, and that the on-field decision shall stand. The third umpire shall not give answers conveying \\\\nlikelihoods or probabilities. \\\\n3.3.7 In circumstances where the television technology (all or parts thereof) is not available to the third umpire or \\\\nfails for whatever reason, the third umpire shall advise the on-field umpire of this fact but still provide any \\\\n \\\\n85 \\\\nrelevant factual information that may be ascertained from the available television replays and other \\\\ntechnology. \\\\n3.3.8 The on-field umpire shall then make his/her decision based on the information provided by the third umpire, \\\\nany other factual information offered by the third umpire and his/her recollection and opinion of the original \\\\nincident. \\\\n3.3.9 The on-field umpire shall reverse his/her decision if the nature of the supplementary information received \\\\nfrom the third umpire leads him/her to conclude that his/her original decision was incorrect. \\\\n3.4 Review of LBW Decisions \\\\n3.4.1 In assessing whether a batter is Out LBW in accordance with clause 36, the third umpire shall first judge \\\\nwhether the delivery is fair (as set out in clause 36.1.1), and second, whether or not the ball has touched the \\\\nbat before being intercepted by any part of the striker’s person (as set out in clause 36.1.3). \\\\n3.4.2 If the batter is still eligible to be Out, the ball-tracking technology shall then present three pieces of \\\\ninformation to the third umpire relating to the path of the ball: \\\\n3.4.2.1 The point of pitching (where applicable) (PITCHING) \\\\n3.4.2.2 The position of the ball at the point of first interception (IMPACT) \\\\n3.4.2.3 Whether the ball would have hit the wicket (WICKET) \\\\n3.4.3 This Decision Review System (DRS) and Third Umpire Protocol includes a category of Umpire’s Call, which \\\\nshall be the conclusion reported where the technology indicates a marginal decision in respect of either the \\\\npoint of first interception or whether the ball would have hit the stumps. \\\\n3.4.4 PITCHING \\\\n3.4.4.1 The interpretation of “pitches in line between wicket and wicket” in clause 36.1.2 shall refer to the \\\\nposition of the centre of the ball at the point of pitching, in relation to the Pitching Zone. \\\\n3.4.4.2 The Pitching Zone is defined as a two dimensional area on the pitch between both sets of stumps \\\\nwith its boundaries consisting of the base of both sets of stumps and a line between the outside of \\\\nthe outer stumps at each end. \\\\n3.4.4.3 Where applicable, the ball-tracking technology shall report that the ball pitched in one of the \\\\nfollowing three areas in relation to the Pitching Zone: \\\\nIn Line The centre of the ball was inside the Pitching Zone \\\\nOutside Off The centre of the ball was outside, and to the off side of, the Pitching \\\\nZone \\\\nOutside Leg The centre of the ball was outside, and to the leg side of, the Pitching \\\\nZone \\\\n \\\\n3.4.4.4 Subject to the satisfaction of the other elements of clause 36, the batter can be Out if the ball-\\\\ntracking technology reports that the ball pitched Outside Off or In Line, but the batter shall be Not \\\\nout if the ball pitched Outside Leg. \\\\n3.4.5 IMPACT \\\\n3.4.5.1 The interpretation of “the (first) point of impact, even if in above the level of the bails, is between \\\\nwicket and wicket” in clause 36.1.4 shall refer to the position of the ball at the point of first \\\\ninterception, in relation to the Impact Zone. \\\\n3.4.5.2 The Impact Zone is defined as a three dimensional space extending between both wickets to an \\\\nindefinite height and with its boundaries consisting of a line between the outside of the outer stumps \\\\nat each end. \\\\n \\\\n86 \\\\n3.4.5.3 The ball-tracking technology shall report that the point of first interception was in one of the \\\\nfollowing categories in relation to the Impact Zone: \\\\nIn Line The centre of the ball was inside the Impact Zone \\\\nUmpire’s Call Some part of the ball was inside the Impact Zone, but the centre of the \\\\nball was outside the Impact Zone, with the further sub-category of \\\\n‘Umpire’s Call (off side)’ where the centre of the ball was to the off side \\\\nof the Impact Zone and the bowler’s end umpire communicates to the \\\\nthird umpire that no genuine attempt to play the ball was made by the \\\\nbatter. \\\\nOutside No part of the ball was inside the Impact Zone, with the further sub-\\\\ncategories of ‘Outside (off)’ and ‘Outside (leg)’ to indicate the location \\\\nof the point of first interception in relation to the Impact Zone when the \\\\nbowler’s end umpire communicates to the third umpire that no genuine \\\\nattempt to play the ball was made by the batter. \\\\n \\\\n3.4.5.4 Where a Not out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batter has made a genuine \\\\nattempt to play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of first interception \\\\nwas In Line for the batter to be eligible to be given Out, otherwise the batter shall remain Not out. \\\\n3.4.5.5 Where a Not out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batter has made no genuine \\\\nattempt to play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of impact was In Line, \\\\nor Umpire’s Call (off side), or Outside (off) for the batter to be eligible to be given Out, otherwise the \\\\nbatter shall remain Not out. \\\\n3.4.5.6 Where an Out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batter has made a genuine \\\\nattempt to play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of first interception \\\\nwas Outside for the decision to be reversed to Not out, otherwise the batter shall remain eligible to \\\\nbe given Out. \\\\n3.4.5.7 Where an Out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batter has made no genuine \\\\nattempt to play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of first interception \\\\nwas Outside (leg) for the decision to be reversed to Not out, otherwise the batter shall remain \\\\neligible to be given Out. \\\\n3.4.6 WICKET \\\\n3.4.6.1 The interpretation of whether “the ball would have hit the wicket” in clause 36.1.5 shall refer to \\\\nposition of the ball as it either hits or passes the wicket, in relation to the Wicket Zone. \\\\n3.4.6.2 The Wicket Zone is defined as a two dimensional area whose boundaries are the outside of the \\\\nouter stumps, the base of the stumps and the top of the stumps. \\\\n3.4.6.3 The ball-tracking technology shall report whether the ball would have hit the wicket with reference to \\\\nthe following three categories: \\\\nHitting The ball was hitting the wicket, and the centre of the ball was inside \\\\nthe Wicket Zone \\\\nUmpire’s Call The ball was hitting the wicket, but the centre of the ball was not inside \\\\nthe Wicket Zone \\\\nMissing The ball was missing the wicket \\\\n \\\\n3.4.6.4 Where a Not out decision is being reviewed, the ball-tracking technology must report that the ball \\\\nwas Hitting for the batter to be eligible to be given Out, otherwise the batter shall remain Not out. \\\\nHowever, where the evidence shows that the ball was Hitting, the point of first interception was \\\\nIn Line, and the ball pitched In Line or Outside Off, but that: \\\\n \\\\n87 \\\\n• The point of first interception was 300cm or more from the stumps; or \\\\n• The point of first interception was more than 250cm but less than 300cm from the stumps \\\\nand the distance between the point of pitching and the point of first interception was less \\\\nthan 40cm, \\\\nthe on-field decision shall stand (that is, Not out). \\\\n3.4.6.5 Where an Out decision is being reviewed, the ball-tracking technology must report that the ball was \\\\nMissing for the on-field decision to be reversed to Not out, otherwise the batter shall remain eligible \\\\nto be given Out. \\\\n3.4.7 When the ball strikes the batter on the full, and the evidence provided by the ball-tracking technology \\\\nindicates that the ball would have pitched before striking or passing the wicket, there will be no information \\\\navailable from that delivery that will allow the ball-tracking technology to accurately predict the height of the \\\\nball after pitching. \\\\n3.4.8 With regard to determining whether the ball would have hit the wicket under these circumstances, the ball-\\\\ntracking technology shall project the line of the ball in accordance with clause 36.2.3 (it is to be assumed \\\\nthat the path of the ball before interception would have continued after interception, irrespective of whether \\\\nthe ball might have pitched subsequently or not), and display the simulated path of the ball from directly \\\\nabove the wicket. \\\\n3.4.9 The third umpire shall advise the bowler’s end umpire only on the point of first interception and whether the \\\\nball would have hit the stumps (in line with the process set out in paragraph 3.4 above), but shall make no \\\\ncomment on the predicted height of the ball after pitching, which shall remain a judgment of the bowler’s end \\\\numpire. \\\\n3.5 The process for communicating the final decision \\\\n3.5.1 For Player Reviews concerning potential dismissals, the relevant on-field umpire shall indicate Out by raising \\\\nhis/her finger above his/her head in a normal yet prominent manner or indicate Not out by the call of ‘not out’ \\\\nand by crossing his/her hands in a horizontal position side to side in front and above his/her waist three \\\\ntimes. Where the decision is a reversal of the on-field umpire’s previous decision, he/she shall make the \\\\n‘revoke last signal’ indication immediately prior to the above. \\\\n3.5.2 If the mode of dismissal is not obvious or not the same as that on which the original decision was based, \\\\nthen the umpire shall advise the scorers via the third umpire. \\\\n3.6 Number of Player Review requests permitted \\\\n3.6.1 In each innings, each team shall be allowed to make a maximum of two Player Review requests that are \\\\ncategorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ (as set out in paragraph 3.6.3 below). \\\\n3.6.2 Where a request for a Player Review results in the original on-field decision being reversed, then the Player \\\\nReview shall be categorised as ‘Successful’ and shall not count towards the innings limit. \\\\n3.6.3 Where a request for a Player Review results in the original on-field decision remaining unchanged (other \\\\nthan in the circumstances set out in paragraphs 3.6.4, 3.6.6 or 3.6.8), the Player Review shall be \\\\ncategorised as ’Unsuccessful’. \\\\n3.6.4 Where a request for a Player Review of an LBW decision results in the on-field decision remaining \\\\nunchanged solely on the basis of an Umpire’s Call, the Player Review shall be categorised as ‘Unchanged – \\\\nUmpire’s Call’. A Player Review categorised as ‘Unchanged – Umpire’s Call’ shall not count towards the \\\\ninnings limit set out in paragraph 3.6.1. \\\\n3.6.5 Where, following a request for a Player Review, the original on-field decision of Out is unchanged, but for a \\\\ndifferent mode of dismissal from the original on-field decision, then the Player Review shall still be \\\\ncategorised as ’Unsuccessful’. \\\\n3.6.6 Where, following a request for a Player Review, the original on-field decision of Not out is unchanged on \\\\naccount of the delivery being a No ball (for any reason), thereby not requiring any further evaluation, the \\\\n \\\\n88 \\\\nPlayer Review shall not be counted as ‘Unsuccessful’ and accordingly shall not count towards the innings \\\\nlimit set out in paragraph 3.6.1. \\\\n3.6.7 Where a Player Review and an Umpire Review are requested from the same delivery and the decision of \\\\nthe third umpire from the Umpire Review renders the Player Review unnecessary (see paragraphs 3.9.2 and \\\\n3.9.3), the Player Review request shall be disregarded and accordingly shall not count towards the innings \\\\nlimit set out in paragraph 3.6.1. \\\\n3.6.8 A Player Review categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ may be reinstated by the ICC Match Referee at his/her sole \\\\ndiscretion (if appropriate after consultation with the ICC Technical Official and/or the television broadcast \\\\ndirector) if the Player Review could not properly be concluded due to a failure of the technology. Any such \\\\ndecision shall be final and shall be taken as soon as possible, being communicated to both teams once all \\\\nthe relevant facts have been ascertained by the ICC Match Referee. A Player Review categorised as \\\\n‘Unsuccessful’ shall not be reinstated if, despite any technical failures, the correct decision could still have \\\\nbeen made using the other available technology. Similarly, a Player Review categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ \\\\nshall not be reinstated where the technology worked as intended, but the evidence gleaned from its use was \\\\ninconclusive. \\\\n3.6.9 The third umpire shall be responsible for counting the number Player Reviews categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ \\\\nand shall advise the on-field umpires once either team has exhausted their allowance for the innings. \\\\n3.6.10 The scoreboard shall display, for the innings in progress, the number of Player Reviews remaining available \\\\nto each team. \\\\nCategory of Player Review Outcome of Player Review  Consequence of Player Review \\\\nSuccessful (paragraph 3.6.2) On-field decision reversed  Does not count towards innings \\\\nlimit set out in paragraph 3.6.1 \\\\nUnsuccessful (paragraphs 3.6.3 \\\\nand 3.6.5) \\\\nOn-field decision unchanged Counts towards innings limit set \\\\nout in paragraph 3.6.1 \\\\nUnchanged – Umpire’s Call \\\\n(paragraph 3.6.4) \\\\nOn-field decision unchanged Does not count towards innings \\\\nlimit set out in paragraph 3.6.1 \\\\nNo ball – no evaluation required \\\\n(paragraph 3.6.6) \\\\nOn-field decision unchanged Does not count towards innings \\\\nlimit set out in paragraph 3.6.1 \\\\nFailure of technology (paragraph \\\\n3.6.8) \\\\nOn-field decision unchanged Does not count towards innings \\\\nlimit set out in paragraph 3.6.1 \\\\n \\\\n3.7 Dead ball \\\\n3.7.1 If following a Player Review request, an original decision of Out is changed to Not out, then the ball is still \\\\ndeemed to have become dead when the original decision was made (as per clause 20.1.1.3). The batting \\\\nside, while benefiting from the reversal of the dismissal, shall not benefit from any runs that may \\\\nsubsequently have accrued from the delivery had the on-field umpire originally made a Not out decision, \\\\nother than any No ball penalty that could arise under paragraph 3.3.5 above. \\\\n3.7.2 If an original decision of Not out is changed to Out, the ball shall retrospectively be deemed to have become \\\\ndead from the moment of the dismissal event. All subsequent events, including any runs scored, shall be \\\\nignored. \\\\n3.8 Use of technology \\\\n3.8.1 The following technology may be used by the third umpire during a Player Review: \\\\n3.8.1.1 Replays, at any speed, from any available broadcast camera \\\\n3.8.1.2 Sound from the stump microphones with the replays at normal speed and slow motion \\\\n \\\\n89 \\\\n3.8.1.3 Approved ball-tracking technology:  \\\\n• HawkEye (HawkEye Innovations), or; \\\\n• VirtualEye (ARL) \\\\n3.8.1.4 Approved sound-based edge detection technology: \\\\n• Real-Time Snickometer (BBG Sports), or; \\\\n• UltraEdge (HawkEye Innovations) \\\\n3.8.1.5 Approved heat-based edge detection technology: \\\\n• Hot Spot cameras (BBG Sports) \\\\n3.8.1.6 LED Wickets (using the lights to indicate if the wicket is broken, as set out in paragraph 4.2): \\\\n• Zing Bails and Stumps \\\\n3.8.2 In addition, other forms of technology may be used subject to the ICC being satisfied that the required \\\\nstandards of accuracy and time efficiency can be met. \\\\n3.8.3 Where practical usage or further testing indicates that any of the above forms of technology cannot reliably \\\\nprovide accurate and timely information, then it may be removed prior to or during a match. The final \\\\ndecision regarding the technology to be used in a given match shall be taken by the ICC Match Referee in \\\\nconsultation with the ICC Technical Official, ICC management and the competing teams’ governing bodies. \\\\n3.9 Combining Umpire Review with Player Review \\\\n3.9.1 If an Umpire Review (under paragraph 2) and a request for a Player Review (under paragraph 3) are made \\\\nfollowing the same delivery but relating to separate modes of dismissal, the following process shall apply. \\\\n3.9.2 The Umpire Review shall be carried out prior to the Player Review if all of the following conditions apply: \\\\n3.9.2.1 The Player Review has been requested by the fielding side \\\\n3.9.2.2 The Umpire Review and the Player Review both relate to the dismissal of the same batter \\\\n3.9.2.3 If the batter is out, the number of runs scored from the delivery would be the same for both modes \\\\nof dismissal \\\\n3.9.2.4 If the batter is out, the batter on strike for the next delivery would be the same for both modes of \\\\ndismissal. \\\\n3.9.3 If the Umpire Review leads the third umpire to make a decision of Out, then this shall be displayed in the \\\\nusual manner and the Player Review shall not be undertaken. If the Umpire Review results in a Not out \\\\ndecision, then the third umpire shall make no public decision but shall proceed to address the request for a \\\\nPlayer Review. \\\\n3.9.4 For illustration, following an LBW appeal which is given Not out by the bowler’s end umpire, the striker sets \\\\noff for a run, is sent back and there is an appeal for his run out. The players request that the LBW decision is \\\\nreviewed and the umpires request that the run out be reviewed. The four criteria above are satisfied, so the \\\\nrun out referral is determined first. Should the appeal for run out be Out, then there is no requirement for the \\\\nLBW review to take place. \\\\n3.9.5 In all other circumstances, the incidents shall be addressed in chronological order. If the conclusion from the \\\\nfirst incident is that a batter is dismissed, then the ball would be deemed to have become dead at that point, \\\\nrendering investigation of the second incident unnecessary. \\\\n4 Interpretation of Playing Conditions \\\\n4.1 When using a replay to determine the moment at which the wicket has been put down (as per clause 29.1), \\\\nthe third umpire shall deem this to be the first frame in which one of the bails is shown (or can be deduced) \\\\n \\\\n90 \\\\nto have lost all contact with the top of the stumps and subsequent frames show the bail permanently \\\\nremoved from the top of the stumps. \\\\n4.2 Where LED Wickets are used (as provided for in paragraph 3.8.1.6) the moment at which the wicket has \\\\nbeen put down (as per clause 29.1) shall be deemed to be the first frame in which the LED lights are \\\\nilluminated and subsequent frames show the bail permanently removed from the top of the stumps. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n91 \\\\nAppendix E  \\\\n \\\\nCalculations  \\\\nTable 1: Calculation sheet for use when a delay or interruptions occur in the First Innings   \\\\nTime  \\\\nNet playing time available at start of the match   420 minutes (A)  \\\\nTime innings in progress      ___________ (B)  \\\\nPlaying time lost       ___________ (C)  \\\\nExtra time available      ___________ (D)  \\\\nTime made up from reduced interval    ___________ (E)  \\\\nEffective playing time lost [C – (D + E)]    ___________ (F)  \\\\nRemaining playing time available (A -

Other than where expressly stated in this Appendix (or by necessary implication), all relevant Playing \\\\nConditions for the match shall apply to the Super Over. \\\\n1. A Super Over involves each team facing an over of six balls (unless ended earlier as provided for in paragraph \\\\n2), and the winner shall be the team scoring the greater number of runs, irrespective of the number of wickets \\\\nlost.  \\\\n \\\\n2. The loss of two wickets shall end the batting team’s one over innings. \\\\n \\\\n3. If the Super Over is a tie, subsequent Super Overs shall be played until a winner is determined. Other than in \\\\nexceptional circumstances (as set out in paragraph 25 below), an unlimited number of Super Overs may be \\\\nplayed where necessary to determine a result. \\\\n \\\\n4. Subject to weather conditions, the Super Over shall take place on the scheduled day of the match at a time to \\\\nbe determined by the ICC Match Referee. In normal circumstances it shall commence 5 minutes after the \\\\nconclusion of the match. \\\\n \\\\n5. The Super Over shall be played until completion, but if there are any delays or interruptions during the Super \\\\nOver, extra time (taken from the start of the first Super Over) is allocated to complete the Super Over or any \\\\nsubsequent Super Overs. The amount of extra time allocated to the Super Over is the greater of; \\\\na) the gap between the time at which the match ended and the time the original match would have been \\\\nscheduled to finish had the entire extra time provision been utilized, or \\\\nb) 20 minutes. \\\\n \\\\n6. Should play be delayed prior to or during the Super Over(s) once the playing time lost exceeds the extra time \\\\nallocated, the Super Over(s) shall be abandoned (see paragraph 24 below). \\\\n \\\\n7. The Super Over shall take place on the pitch allocated for the match, unless otherwise determined by the \\\\numpires in consultation with the Ground Authority and the ICC Match Referee. \\\\n \\\\n8. Only nominated players in the match (including Concussion Replacements) may participate in the Super Over.  \\\\n \\\\n9. Any penalty time being served in the match shall be carried forward to the Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n10. The umpires shall stand at the same end at which they finished the match. \\\\n \\\\n11. The team batting second in the match shall bat first in the Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n12. Each Team shall be allowed one unsuccessful player review per innings per Super Over. This entitlement \\\\nshall apply irrespective of the number of unsuccessful Player Review requests made during the match itself.  \\\\n \\\\n13. The captain of the fielding team (or his nominee) shall select the ball with which the fielding team shall bowl \\\\nits over in the Super Over from the box of spare balls provided by the umpires (which shall include the balls \\\\nused in the match, but no new ball s).  The team fielding second may then choose to use the same ball as \\\\n \\\\n95 \\\\nchosen by the team bowling first or choose another ball from the same box. If the ball needs to be changed, \\\\nthe relevant Playing Conditions as they apply in the match shall also apply in the Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n14. The fielding side shall choose the end from which it is to bowl its one over. \\\\n \\\\n15. The Super Over shall be played with the same fielding restrictions as would be applicable for the last over in \\\\nan uninterrupted match. \\\\n \\\\n16. The interval between the two overs in the Super Over shall be 5 minutes. \\\\n \\\\nTIED SUPER OVER – REPEATING THE SUPER OVER \\\\n \\\\n17. If the Super Over is tied, then subsequent Super Overs shall be played until there is a winner (subject to \\\\nparagraph 25). \\\\n \\\\n18. In normal circumstances any subsequent Super Over shall start 5 minutes after the previous Super Over ends. \\\\n \\\\n19. The team batting second in the previous Super Over shall bat first in the subsequent Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n20. The balls selected for use by each team in the previous Super Over shall be used again by the same team in \\\\nany subsequent Super Over(s). \\\\n \\\\n21. The fielding side shall bowl its over in a subsequent Super Over from the opposite end from which it bowled \\\\nin the previous Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n22. Any batter dismissed in any previous Super Over shall be ineligible to bat in any subsequent Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n23. Any bowler who bowled in the previous Super Over shall be ineligible to bowl in the subsequent Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n24. In all other ways the procedure for a subsequent Super Over shall be the same as for the initial Super Over. \\\\n \\\\nSUPER OVER UNABLE TO BE COMPLETED \\\\n25. Where the Super Over or subsequent Super Overs are abandoned for any reason prior to completion then \\\\nthe match shall be declared a tie and points allocated as in Clause 16.11.1. \\\\n \\\\n26. In circumstances where there are unavoidable time constraints (for example, a requirement to switch off \\\\nfloodlights at a certain time) which do not allow the completion of multiple Super Overs, the ICC Match Referee \\\\nmay limit the number of possible Super O vers and shall advise both captains accordingly prior to the start of \\\\nthe first Super Over. \\\\n \\\\nEXAMPLES - EXTRA TIME AVAILABLE FOR THE SUPER OVER \\\\nExample 1: The match is scheduled to finish at 10.20pm, with 60 minutes of extra time available to be used. The \\\\nscheduled cut-off time if all the available extra time is used would be 11.20pm. The match runs over time and finishes \\\\nin a tie at 10.35pm. The Super Over is scheduled to start 5 minutes later at 10.40pm. The extra time available to \\\\ncomplete the Super Over would be 45 minutes (as per paragraph 5(a) above). \\\\n• The Super Over starts on time but is interrupted at 10.50pm for 10 minutes (leaving 35 minutes of extra time still \\\\navailable). \\\\n• Play resumes at 11.00pm with a tied Super Over occurring. \\\\n• The second super over is being played but is interrupted at 11.15pm. \\\\n \\\\n96 \\\\n• Play does not resume within 35 minutes (being the amount of extra time still available), therefore the Super Over \\\\nprocedure is abandoned, and the match is a tie. \\\\nExample 2: The same match is scheduled to finish at 10.20pm, but with 30 minutes of extra time available to be used. \\\\nThe scheduled cut -off time if all the available extra time is used would be 10.50pm. The match runs over time and \\\\nfinishes in a tie at 10.35pm. The Super Over is scheduled to start 5 minutes later at 10.40pm. The extra time available \\\\nto complete the Super Over would be 20 minutes (as per paragraph 5(b) above). \\\\n \\\\nAppendix H \\\\nOn Field Injury Assessments and Treatment \\\\nThe umpires will allow an initial 4 minutes for medical staff to treat the injured player. Umpires may inform the medical \\\\nteam when there is 90 seconds remaining, after which, the player should be removed from the field of play if further \\\\nassessment/treatment is required. The on-field umpires will consider each incident when applying the 4-minute \\\\nguideline and be guided by the appointed Match Day Doctor or his/her nominated replacement. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\"}{\\'filename\\': \\'rule_word.docx\\', \\'text\\': \\'CRICKET All players need to have signed up on IM leagues and have signed the activity consent form BEFORE they may participate in their first game. All players must present their ID prior to each game. No one will be permitted to play without their ID. No Exceptions! Official Cricket Rules will be applied, however the Campus Recreation Staff will have the final say on all rules and their application. Spectators must remain in the designated seating area. Misconduct of spectators, players or coaches can result in an ejection or forfeiture of the game. • Match format is a form of limited overs cricket in that it involves two teams, each with a single innings. The key feature is that each team bats for a maximum of 7 overs (42 legal balls). • Teams consist of 11 players each, There is also a reserve player called a “twelfth man” who is used should a player be injured during play. • The twelfth man is not allowed to bowl, bat, wicket keep or captain the team. His sole duty is to act as a substitute fielder. • Teams are open to both genders but do not require a certain amount to play. • Closed toed shoes must be worn while playing. • Once the first team bats 7 overs or has been bowled out then the second team will go into bat. • The original player is free to return to the game as soon as they have recovered from their injury. • To apply the law and make sure the cricket rules are upheld throughout the game there are two umpires in place during games. Umpires are responsible for making decisions and notifying the scorers of these decisions. • Each bowler may bowl a maximum of only 2 overs per innings. For a full, uninterrupted match, this is four overs. • If a bowler delivers a no-ball by overstepping the crease, it costs one run and their next delivery is designated a \"freehit\". In this circumstance the batter can only be dismissed through a run out, hitting the ball twice or obstructing the field. • No more than five fielders can be on the leg side at any time. • During the first 2 overs, a maximum of two fielders can be outside the 30-yard circle (this is known as the powerplay). • After the first 2 overs, a maximum of five fielders can be outside the fielding circle.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWays to score runs (No Leg Bye) The aim of the batsmen is to score runs. One of the main cricket rules is that for batsmen to score runs they must run to each other’s end of the pitch (from one end to the other). In doing this one run is scored. Cricket rules state they may run multiple runs per shot. As well as running they can also score runs by hitting boundaries. A boundary scores the batsmen either 4 or 6 runs. A four is scored by hitting the ball past the boundary after hitting the ground while a six is scored by hitting the ball past the boundary on the full (before it hits the ground). Cricket rules also state that once a 4 or 6 has been scored any runs physically ran by the batsman are null & void. They will only obtain the 4 or 6 runs. Other ways runs can be scored according to the cricket rules include no balls, wide balls & byes. Cricket rules state that all runs scored by these methods are awarded to the batting team but not the individual batters. • A “No Ball” can be declared for many reasons: If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong place, the ball is declared dangerous (often happens when bowled at the batsmen’s body on the full), bounces more than twice or rolls before IM Rules 2021 2 | P a g e reaching the batsman or if fielders are standing in illegal positions. The batsman can hit a no ball and score runs off it but cannot be out from a no ball except if they are ran out, hit the ball twice, handle the ball or obstruct the field. The batsman gains any runs scored off the no ball for his shot while the team also gains one run for the no ball itself. • A “Wide Ball” will be declared if the umpire thinks the batsman did not have a reasonable opportunity to score off the delivery. However if the delivery is bowled over the batsmen’s head it will not be declared a wide but a no ball. Umpires are much stricter on wide deliveries in the shorter format of the game while being much more relaxed in test cricket. A wide delivery will add one run to the batting team and any runs scored by the batsman. The batsman is not able to get out off a wide delivery except if they are stumped, run out, handle the ball, hit their wicket or obstruct the field. • A “Bye” is where a ball that isn’t a no ball or wide passes the striking batsman and runs are scored without the batsman hitting the ball.\\\\n\\\\nWays Batsmen can be given out according to cricket rules (No LBW) There are a number of different ways a batsman can be given out in the game of cricket. When a bowler gets a batsman out it is said that the bowler gets a “wicket”. Following are the different ways a batsman can be given out according to the rules of cricket: • Bowled – Cricket rules state that if the ball is bowled and hits the striking batsman’s wickets the batsman is given out (as long as at least one bail is removed by the ball). It does not matter whether the ball has touched the batsman’s bat, gloves, body or any other part of the batsman. However the ball is not allowed to have touched another player or umpire before hitting the wickets. • Caught – Cricket rules state that if a batsman hits the ball or touches the ball at all with his bat or hand/glove holding the bat then the batsman can be caught out. This is done by the fielders, wicket keeper or bowler catching the ball on the full (before it bounces). If this is done then cricket rules state the batsman is out. • Stumped – A batsman can be given out according to cricket rules when the wicketkeeper puts down his wicket while he is out of his crease and not attempting a run (if he is attempting a run it would be a runout). • Run Out – Cricket rules state that a batsman is out if no part of his bat or body is grounded behind the popping crease while the ball is in play and the wicket is fairly put down by the fielding side. • Hit Wicket – Cricket rules specify that if a batsman hits his wicket down with his bat or body after the bowler has entered his delivery stride and the ball is in play then he is out. The striking batsman is also out if he hits his wicket down while setting off for his first run. • Handled The Ball – Cricket rules allow the batsman to be given out if he willingly handles the ball with the hand that is not touching the bat without the consent of the opposition. • Timed Out – An incoming batsman must be ready to face a ball or be at the non-strikers end with his partner within three minutes of the outgoing batsman being dismissed. If this is not done the incoming batsman can be given out. • Hit The Ball Twice – Cricket rules state that if a batsman hits a ball twice other than for the purpose of protecting his wicket or with consent from the opposition he is out. • Obstructing The Field – A batsman is out if he willingly obstructs the opposition by word or action.\\\\n\\'}{\\'filename\\': \\'woman rules.pdf\\',

\\\\nCricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only according to the Laws \\\\n(which are incorporated within these Playing Conditions), but also within the Spirit of Cricket.  \\\\nThe major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains, but extends to all players, match officials and, \\\\nespecially in junior cricket, teachers, coaches and parents. \\\\nRespect is central to the Spirit of Cricket. \\\\nRespect your captain, team-mates, opponents and the authority of the umpires. \\\\nPlay hard and play fair. \\\\nAccept the umpire’s decision. \\\\nCreate a positive atmosphere by your own conduct, and encourage others to do likewise. \\\\nShow self-discipline, even when things go against you. \\\\nCongratulate the opposition on their successes, and enjoy those of your own team. \\\\nThank the officials and your opposition at the end of the match, whatever the result. \\\\nCricket is an exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship and teamwork, which brings together people from \\\\ndifferent nationalities, cultures and religions, especially when played within the Spirit of Cricket. \\\\n1 THE PLAYERS \\\\n1.1 Number of players \\\\nA match is played between two sides, each of eleven players, one of whom shall be captain. \\\\n1.2 Nomination and replacement of players \\\\n1.2.1 Each captain shall nominate 11 players plus a maximum of 6 substitute fielders in writing to the ICC Match \\\\nReferee before the toss. Other than as set out in clause 1.2.7, no player (member of the playing eleven) may \\\\nbe changed after the nomination and prior to the start of play without the consent of the opposing captain. \\\\n1.2.2 Only those nominated as substitute fielders shall be entitled to act as substitute fielders during the match, \\\\nunless the ICC Match Referee, in exceptional circumstances, allows subsequent additions. \\\\n1.2.3 All those nominated including those nominated as substitute fielders, as well as any Concussion, must be \\\\neligible to play for that particular team and by such nomination the nominees shall warrant that they are so \\\\neligible. \\\\n1.2.4 In addition, by their nomination, the nominees shall be deemed to have agreed to abide by all the applicable \\\\nICC Regulations pertaining to international cricket and in particular, the Clothing and Equipment \\\\nRegulations, the Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel (hereafter referred to as the \\\\nICC Code of Conduct), the Anti-Racism Code for Players and Player Support Personnel, the Anti-Doping \\\\nCode and the Anti-Corruption Code. \\\\n1.2.5 A player or player support personnel who has been suspended from participating in a match shall not, from \\\\nthe toss of the coin and for the remainder of the match thereafter: \\\\n1.2.5.1 Be nominated as, or carry out any of the duties or responsibilities of a substitute fielder, or \\\\n1.2.5.2 Enter any part of the playing area (which shall include the field of play and the area between the boundary \\\\nand the perimeter boards) at any time, including any scheduled or unscheduled breaks in play. \\\\n1.2.6 A player who has been suspended from participating in a match shall be permitted from the toss of the coin \\\\nand for the remainder of the match thereafter be permitted to enter the players’ dressing room provided that \\\\n2 \\\\nthe players’ dressing room (or any part thereof) for the match is not within the playing area described in \\\\nclause 1.2.5.2 above (for example, the player is not permitted to enter the on-field ‘dug-out’) \\\\n1.2.7 Concussion Replacement \\\\n1.2.7.1 a player sustains a concussion or suspected concussion as a result of a head or neck injury during the \\\\ncourse of the relevant match, a Concussion Replacement may be permitted in the following \\\\ncircumstances: \\\\n1.2.7.1.1 the head or neck injury must have been sustained during play and within the playing area \\\\ndescribed in clause 1.2.5.2 above; \\\\n1.2.7.1.2 a concussion or suspected concussion must have been formally diagnosed by the Team \\\\nMedical Representative or in consultation with the Match Day Doctor; \\\\n1.2.7.1.3 the Team Medical Representative or Team Manager shall submit a Concussion \\\\nReplacement Request to the ICC Match Referee on a standard form, which shall: \\\\n1.2.7.1.3.1 identify the player who has sustained the concussion or suspected concussion;  \\\\n1.2.7.1.3.2 specify the incident in which the concussion or suspected concussion was \\\\nsustained, including the time at which it occurred; \\\\n1.2.7.1.3.3 confirm that, following an examination, the Team Medical Representative or in \\\\nconsultation with the Match Day Doctor, believes or suspects that the player has \\\\nsustained a concussion as a result of the incident specified in clause 1.2.7.3.2 \\\\nabove; and  \\\\n1.2.7.1.3.4 identify the requested Concussion Replacement, who shall be a like-for-like \\\\nreplacement for the player who has sustained the concussion or suspected \\\\nconcussion. \\\\n1.2.7.2 The Concussion Replacement Request must be submitted within 36 hours of the incident specified in \\\\nclause 1.2.7.3.2 if a Concussion Replacement is to be permitted. \\\\n1.2.7.3 The ICC Match Referee should ordinarily approve a Concussion Replacement Request if the replacement \\\\nis a like-for-like player whose inclusion will not excessively advantage his team for the remainder of the \\\\nmatch. \\\\n1.2.7.4 In assessing whether the nominated Concussion Replacement should be considered a like-for-like player, \\\\nthe ICC Match Referee should consider the likely role the concussed player would have played during the \\\\nremainder of the match, and the normal role that would be performed by the nominated Concussion \\\\nReplacement. \\\\n1.2.7.5 If the ICC Match Referee believes that the inclusion of the nominated Concussion Replacement, when \\\\nperforming their normal role, would excessively advantage their team, the Match Referee may impose \\\\nsuch conditions upon the identity and involvement of the Concussion Replacement as he/she sees fit, in \\\\nline with the overriding objective of facilitating a like-for-like replacement for the concussed player. \\\\n \\\\nFor clarity, a concussion replacement will not be permitted to bowl during the innings and/or for the \\\\nremainder of the match if the replaced player was suspended from bowling for any reason at the time they \\\\nwere replaced. \\\\n1.2.7.6 The ICC Match Referee may, in reviewing a Concussion Replacement Request made in accordance with \\\\nclause 1.2.7.1.3, request any such further information as may be required in order to make the \\\\ndetermination required under clauses 1.2.7.1.1 and 1.2.7.1.2. 1.2.7.4 and 1.2.7.5. \\\\n1.2.7.7 The decision of the ICC Match Referee in relation to any Concussion Replacement Request shall be final \\\\nand neither team shall have any right of appeal. \\\\n1.2.7.8 Once the Concussion Replacement has been approved by the ICC Match Referee, the replaced player \\\\nshall play no further part in the match. \\\\n1.2.7.9 Both the Concussion Replacement and the replaced player shall be considered to have played in the \\\\nmatch for records and statistical purposes. \\\\n1.2.7.10   \\\\n \\\\n3 \\\\n1.3 Captain \\\\n1.3.1 If at any time the captain is not available, a deputy shall act for her. \\\\n1.3.2 If a captain is not available to nominate the players, then any person associated with that team may act as \\\\nher deputy to do so. See clause 1.2. \\\\n1.3.3 At any time after the nomination of the players, only a nominated player can act as deputy in discharging the \\\\nduties and responsibilities of the captain as stated in these Playing Conditions, including at the toss. See \\\\nclause 13.4(The toss). \\\\n1.4 Responsibility of captains \\\\nThe captains are responsible at all times for ensuring that play is conducted within the Spirit of Cricket, as well as \\\\nwithin these Playing Conditions. \\\\n2 THE UMPIRES \\\\n2.1 Appointment and attendance \\\\nThe following rules for the selection and appointment of umpires shall be followed as far as it is practicable to do so: \\\\n2.1.1 The umpires shall control the game as required by these Playing Conditions, with absolute impartiality and \\\\nshall be present at the ground at least two hours before the scheduled start of the first day’s play, and at \\\\nleast 1.5 hours before the scheduled start of each succeeding day’s play. \\\\n2.1.2 The Home Board shall appoint all umpires to stand in each match in the following manner: \\\\nFor televised matches with DRS: \\\\n2.1.2.1 Two (2) on-field umpires and one (1) third umpire from their representatives on an ICC Panel or First Class \\\\nPanel of umpires. The third umpire must be a member of an ICC Panel of umpires. The Playing Conditions \\\\ngoverning the use of DRS are included in Appendix D. \\\\n2.1.2.2 One (1) fourth umpire appointed by the Home Board from their representatives on an ICC Panel or First \\\\nClass Panel of umpires. The fourth umpire shall act as the emergency on-field umpire. \\\\nFor matches with no DRS: \\\\n2.1.2.3 Two (2) on-field umpires and one (1) third umpire from their representatives on an ICC Panel of Umpires \\\\nor First Class Panel of Umpires. The third umpire shall act as emergency on-field umpire. \\\\n2.1.2.4 Where the match is televised or streamed with a provision of TV Umpire replays, one (1) fourth umpire, \\\\nappointed by the Home Board from their representatives on an ICC Panel of Umpires or First Class Panel \\\\nof Umpires, to act as emergency third umpire. \\\\n \\\\n2.1.3 As early as possible before each match, the Home Board will advise the ICC of the names of its appointees \\\\nand will advise the Manager of the visiting team of all umpires’ names. \\\\n2.1.4 The Home Board shall appoint a match referee for all matches (ICC Match Referee) from its International \\\\nPanel of ICC Match Referees. \\\\n2.1.5 Neither team will have a right of objection to the appointment of any umpire or ICC Match Referee. \\\\n2.2 Change of umpire \\\\nAn umpire shall not be changed during the match, other than in exceptional circumstances, unless he/she is injured \\\\nor ill. \\\\n2.3 Consultation with Home Board \\\\nBefore the match the umpires shall consult with the Home Board to determine: \\\\n4 \\\\n2.3.1 the balls to be used during the match. See clause 4 (The ball). \\\\n2.3.2 the hours of play and the times and durations of any agreed intervals.  \\\\n2.3.3 which clock or watch and back-up time piece is to be used during the match. \\\\n2.3.4 the boundary of the field of play. See clause 19 (Boundaries). \\\\n2.3.5 the use of covers. See clause 10 (Covering the pitch). \\\\n2.3.6 any special conditions of play affecting the conduct of the match. \\\\n2.4 The wickets, creases and boundaries \\\\nBefore the toss and during the match, the umpires shall satisfy themselves that \\\\n2.4.1 the creases are correctly marked. See clause 7 (The creases). \\\\n2.4.2 the wickets are properly pitched. See clause 8 (The wickets). \\\\n2.4.3 the boundary of the field of play complies with the requirements of clauses 19.1 (Determining the boundary \\\\nof the field of play), 19.2 (Identifying and marking the boundary) and 19.3 (Restoring the boundary). \\\\n2.5 Conduct of the match, implements and equipment \\\\nBefore the toss and during the match, the umpires shall satisfy themselves that \\\\n2.5.1 the conduct of the match is strictly in accordance with these Playing Conditions. \\\\n2.5.2 the implements used in the match conform to the following \\\\n2.5.2.1 clause 4 (The ball). \\\\n2.5.2.2 externally visible requirements of clause 5 (The bat) and paragraph 1 of Appendix B. \\\\n2.5.2.3 either clauses 8.2 (Size of stumps) and 8.3 (The bails). \\\\n2.5.3 no player uses equipment other than that permitted. See paragraph 2 of Appendix A. Note particularly \\\\ntherein the interpretation of ‘protective helmet’. \\\\n2.5.4 the wicket-keeper’s gloves comply with the requirements of clause 27.2 (Gloves). \\\\n2.6 Fair and unfair play \\\\nThe umpires shall be the sole judges of fair and unfair play. \\\\n2.7 Fitness for play \\\\n2.7.1 It is solely for the umpires together to decide whether either conditions of ground, weather or light or \\\\nexceptional circumstances mean that it would be dangerous or unreasonable for play to take place. \\\\nConditions shall not be regarded as either dangerous or unreasonable merely because they are not ideal. \\\\nThe fact that the grass and the ball are wet does not warrant the ground conditions being regarded as \\\\nunreasonable or dangerous. \\\\n2.7.2 Conditions shall be regarded as dangerous if there is actual and foreseeable risk to the safety of any player \\\\nor umpire. \\\\n2.7.3 Conditions shall be regarded as unreasonable if, although posing no risk to safety, it would not be sensible \\\\nfor play to proceed. \\\\n2.7.4 If the umpires consider the ground is so wet or slippery as to deprive the bowler of a reasonable foothold, \\\\nthe fielders of the power of free movement, or the batters of the ability to play their strokes or to run between \\\\nthe wickets, then these conditions shall be regarded as so bad that it would be dangerous and unreasonable \\\\nfor play to take place. \\\\n5 \\\\n2.8 Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable circumstances \\\\n2.8.1 All references to ground include the pitch. See clause 6.1 (Area of pitch). \\\\n2.8.2 If at any time the umpires together agree that the conditions of ground, weather or light, or any other \\\\ncircumstances are dangerous or unreasonable, they shall immediately suspend play, or not allow play to \\\\nstart or to recommence. The decision as to whether conditions are so bad as to warrant such action is one \\\\nfor the umpires alone to make, following consultation with the ICC Match Referee. \\\\n2.8.3 If circumstances are warranted, the umpires shall stop play and instruct the Ground Authority to take \\\\nwhatever action they can and use whatever equipment is necessary to remove as much dew as possible \\\\nfrom the outfield when conditions become unreasonable or dangerous. The umpires may also instruct the \\\\nground staff to take such action during scheduled and unscheduled breaks in play. \\\\n2.8.4 The umpires shall disregard any shadow on the pitch from the stadium or from any permanent object on the \\\\nground. \\\\n2.8.5 Light Meters \\\\nIt is the responsibility of the Home Board to supply light meters to the match officials to be used in \\\\naccordance with these playing conditions. \\\\n2.8.5.1 All light meters shall be uniformly calibrated. \\\\n2.8.5.2 The umpires shall be entitled to use light meter readings as a guideline for determining whether the light is \\\\nfit for play in accordance with the criteria set out in clause 2.8.2 above. \\\\n2.8.5.3 Light meter readings may accordingly be used by the umpires: \\\\n2.8.5.3.1 To determine whether there has been at any stage a deterioration or improvement in \\\\nthe light. \\\\n2.8.5.3.2 As benchmarks for the remainder of the match. \\\\n2.8.6 Use of artificial lights \\\\nIf in the opinion of the umpires, natural light is deteriorating to an unfit level, they shall authorize the Ground \\\\nAuthority to use the available artificial lighting so that the match can commence or continue in acceptable \\\\nconditions. \\\\nIn the event of power failure or lights malfunction, the provisions relating to the delay or interruption of play \\\\ndue to bad weather or light shall apply. \\\\nHome Boards may, prior to the commencement of the series, seek the approval of the ICC to amend this \\\\nplaying condition to provide that artificial lights will not be used at specific venues. \\\\nFor day/night Test matches, the latest times at which the floodlights are to be switched on each day shall be \\\\ndecided by the Home Board prior to the match and the ICC Match Referee shall be duly informed. \\\\n2.8.7 When there is a suspension of play it is the responsibility of the umpires to monitor conditions. They shall \\\\nmake inspections as often as appropriate, unaccompanied by any players or officials. Immediately the \\\\numpires together agree that the conditions are no longer dangerous or unreasonable they shall call upon the \\\\nplayers to resume play. \\\\n2.8.8 The safety of all persons within the ground is of paramount importance to the ICC. In the event that of any \\\\nthreatening circumstance, whether actual or perceived (including for example weather, pitch invasions, act \\\\nof God, etc.), then the umpires, on the advice of the ICC Match Referee, should suspend play and all \\\\nplayers and officials should immediately be asked to leave the field of play in a safe and orderly manner and \\\\nto relocate to a secure and safe area (depending on each particular threat) pending the satisfactory passing \\\\nor resolution of such threat or risk to the reasonable satisfaction of the umpires, the ICC Match Referee, the \\\\nhead of the relevant Ground Authority, the head of ground security and/or the police as the circumstances \\\\nmay require. \\\\n6 \\\\n2.8.9 Where play is suspended under clause 2.8.8 above the decision to abandon or resume play shall be the \\\\nresponsibility of the ICC Match Referee who shall act only after consultation with the head of ground security \\\\nand the police. \\\\n2.9 Position of umpires \\\\nThe umpires shall stand where they can best see any act upon which their decision may be required. \\\\nSubject to this over-riding consideration, the bowler’s end umpire shall stand in a position so as not to interfere with \\\\neither the bowler’s run-up or the striker’s view. \\\\nThe striker’s end umpire may elect to stand on the off side instead of the on side of the pitch, provided she informs \\\\nthe captain of the fielding side, the striker and the other umpire. \\\\n2.10 Umpires changing ends \\\\nThe umpires shall change ends after each side has had one completed innings. See clause 13.3 (Completed \\\\ninnings). \\\\n2.11 Disagreement and dispute \\\\nWhere there is disagreement or dispute about any matter, the umpires together shall make the final decision. See \\\\nalso clause 31.6 (Consultation by umpires). \\\\n2.12 Umpire’s decision \\\\nAn umpire may alter any decision provided that such alteration is made promptly and does not contradict clause 20.6 \\\\n(Dead ball not to be revoked). This apart, an umpire’s decision, once made, is final. \\\\n2.13 Signals \\\\n2.13.1 The following code of signals shall be used by umpires. \\\\n7 \\\\n2.13.1.1 Signals made while the ball is in play \\\\nNo ball - by extending one arm horizontally. \\\\nOut - by raising an index finger above the head. (If not out, the umpire shall call Not out.) \\\\nWide - by extending both arms horizontally. \\\\nDead ball - by crossing and re-crossing the wrists below the waist. \\\\n2.13.1.2 When the ball is dead, the bowler’s end umpire shall repeat the signals in clause 2.13.1.1, with the \\\\nexception of the signal for Out, to the scorers. \\\\n2.13.1.3 The signals listed below shall be made to the scorers only when the ball is dead. \\\\nBoundary 4 - by waving an arm from side to side finishing with the arm across the chest \\\\nBoundary 6 - by raising both arms above the head. \\\\nBye - by raising an open hand above the head. \\\\nCommencement of last hour - by pointing to a raised wrist with the other hand. \\\\nFive Penalty runs awarded to the batting side - by repeated tapping of one shoulder with the \\\\nopposite hand. \\\\nFive Penalty runs awarded to the fielding side - by placing one hand on the opposite shoulder. \\\\nLeg bye - by touching a raised knee with the hand. \\\\nNew ball - by holding the ball above the head. \\\\nRevoke last signal - by touching both shoulders, each with the opposite hand. \\\\nShort run - by bending one arm upwards and touching the nearer shoulder with the tips of the \\\\nfingers. \\\\nThe following signal is for Level 4 player conduct offences. The signal has two parts, both of which \\\\nshould be acknowledged separately by the scorers. \\\\nLevel 4 conduct Part 1 - by putting one arm out to the side of the body and repeatedly \\\\nraising it and lowering it. \\\\nPart 2 - by raising an index finger, held at shoulder height, to the side of \\\\nthe body. \\\\n2.13.1.4 All the signals in clause 2.13.1.3 are to be made by the bowler’s end umpire except that for Short run, \\\\nwhich is to be signalled by the umpire at the end where short running occurs. However, the bowler’s end \\\\numpire shall be responsible both for the final signal of Short run to the scorers and, if more than one run is \\\\nshort, for informing them as to the number of runs to be recorded. \\\\n2.13.2 The umpire shall wait until each signal to the scorers has been separately acknowledged by a scorer before \\\\nallowing play to proceed. \\\\nIf several signals are to be used, they should be given in the order that the events occurred. \\\\n2.14 Informing the umpires \\\\nWherever the umpires are to receive information from captains or other players under these Playing Conditions, it will \\\\nbe sufficient for one umpire to be so informed and for him/her to inform the other umpire. \\\\n2.15 Correctness of scores \\\\nConsultation between umpires and scorers on doubtful points is essential. The umpires shall, throughout the match, \\\\nsatisfy themselves as to the correctness of the number of runs scored, the wickets that have fallen and, where \\\\nappropriate, the number of overs bowled.  \\\\n8 \\\\nThe umpires shall ensure that they are able to contact the scorers at any time during the match and at its conclusion \\\\nto address any issues relating to the correctness of scores. \\\\n3 THE SCORERS \\\\n3.1 Appointment of scorers \\\\nTwo scorers shall be appointed to record all runs scored, all wickets taken and, where appropriate, number of overs \\\\nbowled. \\\\n3.2 Correctness of scores \\\\nThe scorers shall frequently check to ensure that their records agree and consult with the umpires if necessary. See \\\\nclause 2.15 (Correctness of scores). \\\\n3.3 Acknowledging signals \\\\nThe scorers shall accept all instructions and signals given to them by the umpires and shall immediately acknowledge \\\\neach separate signal. \\\\n4 THE BALL \\\\n4.1 Weight and size \\\\nThe ball, when new, shall weigh not less than 4.94 ounces/140 g, nor more than 5.31 ounces/151 g, and shall \\\\nmeasure not less than 8.25 in/21.0 cm, nor more than 8.88 in/22.5 cm in circumference. \\\\n4.2 Approval and control of balls \\\\n4.2.1 The Home Board shall provide the best available high quality red cricket balls (e.g. Kookaburra ‘Turf’ or its \\\\nequivalent) and spare used balls for changing during a match, which shall also be of the same brand. Note: \\\\nThe Home Board shall be required to advise the Visiting Board of the brand of ball to be used in the \\\\nmatch(es) at least 30 days prior to the start of the match(es). \\\\n4.2.2 The fielding captain or her nominee may select the ball with which she wishes to bowl from the supply \\\\nprovided by the Home Board. The reserve umpire shall take a box containing at least 6 new balls to the \\\\ndressing room and supervise the selection of the ball. \\\\n4.2.3 The umpires shall retain possession of the match ball(s) throughout the duration of the match when play is \\\\nnot actually taking place. \\\\n4.2.4 During play umpires shall periodically and irregularly inspect the condition of the ball and shall retain \\\\npossession of it at the fall of a wicket, a drinks interval, or any other disruption in play. \\\\n4.3 New ball \\\\nA new ball shall be used at the start of each innings. \\\\n4.4 New ball available after 80 overs \\\\nThe captain of the fielding side may demand a new ball when the number of overs, excluding any part overs, bowled \\\\nwith the old one is equal to or greater than 80 overs. The umpire shall inform the other umpire and indicate to the \\\\nbatters and the scorers whenever a new ball is taken into play. \\\\n4.5 Ball lost or becoming unfit for play \\\\nIf, during play, the ball cannot be found or recovered or the umpires agree that it has become unfit for play through \\\\nnormal use, the umpires shall replace it with a ball which has had wear comparable with that which the previous ball \\\\nhad received before the need for its replacement. When the ball is replaced, the umpires shall inform the batters and \\\\nthe fielding captain. \\\\n9 \\\\nHowever, if the ball needs to be replaced after 110 overs for any of the reasons above, it shall be replaced by a new \\\\nball. If the ball is to be replaced, the umpires shall inform the batters, the fielding captain and the scorers. \\\\n5 THE BAT \\\\n5.1 The bat \\\\n5.1.1 The bat consists of two parts, a handle and a blade. \\\\n5.1.2 The basic requirements and measurements of the bat are set out in this clause with detailed specifications in \\\\nparagraph 1 of Appendix B. \\\\n5.2 The handle \\\\n5.2.1 The handle is to be made principally of cane and/or wood. \\\\n5.2.2 The part of the handle that is wholly outside the blade is defined to be the upper portion of the handle. It is a \\\\nstraight shaft for holding the bat. \\\\n5.2.3 The upper portion of the handle may be covered with a grip as defined in paragraph 1.2.2 of Appendix B. \\\\n5.3 The blade \\\\n5.3.1 The blade comprises the whole of the bat apart from the handle as defined in clause 5.2 and in paragraph \\\\n1.3 of Appendix B. \\\\n5.3.2 The blade shall consist solely of wood. \\\\n5.4 Protection and repair \\\\nSubject to the specifications in paragraph 1.4 of Appendix B and providing clause 5.5 is not contravened, \\\\n5.4.1 solely for the purposes of \\\\neither protection from surface damage to the face, sides and shoulders of the blade \\\\nor repair to the blade after surface damage, \\\\nmaterial that is not rigid, either at the time of its application to the blade or subsequently, may be placed on \\\\nthese surfaces. \\\\n5.4.2 for repair of the blade after damage other than surface damage \\\\n5.4.2.1 solid material may be inserted into the blade. \\\\n5.4.2.2 The only material permitted for any insertion is wood with minimal essential adhesives. \\\\n5.4.3 to prevent damage to the toe, material may be placed on that part of the blade but shall not extend over any \\\\npart of the face, back or sides of the blade. \\\\n5.5 Damage to the ball \\\\n5.5.1 For any part of the bat, covered or uncovered, the hardness of the constituent materials and the surface \\\\ntexture thereof shall not be such that either or both could cause unacceptable damage to the ball. \\\\n5.5.2 Any material placed on any part of the bat, for whatever purpose, shall similarly not be such that it could \\\\ncause unacceptable damage to the ball. \\\\n5.5.3 For the purpose of this clause, unacceptable damage is any change that is greater than normal wear and \\\\ntear caused by the ball striking the uncovered wooden surface of the blade. \\\\n5.6 Contact with the ball \\\\nIn these clauses, \\\\n10 \\\\n5.6.1 reference to the bat shall imply that the bat is held in the batter’s hand or a glove worn on her hand, unless \\\\nstated otherwise. \\\\n5.6.2 contact between the ball and any of 5.6.2.1 to 5.6.2.4 \\\\n5.6.2.1 the bat itself \\\\n5.6.2.2 the batter’s hand holding the bat \\\\n5.6.2.3 any part of a glove worn on the batter’s hand holding the bat \\\\n5.6.2.4 any additional materials permitted under 5.4 \\\\nshall be regarded as the ball striking or touching the bat or being struck by the bat. \\\\n5.7 Bat size limits \\\\n5.7.1 The overall length of the bat, when the lower portion of the handle is inserted, shall not be more than 38 \\\\nin/96.52 cm. \\\\n5.7.2 The blade of the bat shall not exceed the following dimensions: \\\\nWidth: 4.25in / 10.8 cm \\\\nDepth: 2.64in / 6.7 cm \\\\nEdges: 1.56in / 4.0cm. \\\\nFurthermore, it should also be able to pass through a bat gauge as described in paragraph 1.6 of \\\\nAppendix B. \\\\n5.7.3 The handle shall not exceed 52% of the overall length of the bat. \\\\n5.7.4 The material permitted for covering the blade in clause 5.4.1 shall not exceed 0.04 in/0.1 cm in thickness. \\\\n5.7.5 The maximum permitted thickness of protective material placed on the toe of the blade is 0.12 in/0.3 cm. \\\\n5.8 Categories of bat \\\\n5.8.1 Type A bats conform to clause 5.1 to 5.7 inclusive. \\\\n5.8.2 Only Type A bats may be used in Test matches. \\\\n \\\\n6 THE PITCH \\\\n6.1 Area of pitch \\\\nThe pitch is a rectangular area of the ground 22 yards/20.12 m in length and 10 ft/3.05 m in width. It is bounded at \\\\neither end by the bowling creases and on either side by imaginary lines, one each side of the imaginary line joining \\\\nthe centres of the two middle stumps, each parallel to it and 5 ft/1.52 m from it. If the pitch is next to an artificial pitch \\\\nwhich is closer than 5 ft/1.52 m from the middle stumps, the pitch on that side will extend only to the junction of the \\\\ntwo surfaces. See clauses 8.1 (Description, width and pitching) 7.2 (The bowling crease) and Appendix C. \\\\n6.2 Fitness of pitch for play \\\\nThe umpires shall be the sole judges of the fitness of the pitch for play. See clauses 2.7 (Fitness for play), 2.8 \\\\n(Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable conditions) and 6.4 (changing the pitch). \\\\n6.3 Selection and preparation \\\\nBefore the match, the Ground Authority shall be responsible for the selection and preparation of the pitch. During the \\\\nmatch, the umpires shall control its use and maintenance. \\\\n11 \\\\n6.3.1 The Ground Authority shall ensure that during the period prior to the start of play and during intervals, the \\\\npitch area shall be roped off so as to prevent unauthorised access. (The pitch area shall include an area at \\\\nleast 2 metres beyond the rectangle made by the crease markings at both ends of the pitch). \\\\n6.3.2 The reserve umpire shall ensure that, prior to the start of play and during any intervals, only authorised staff, \\\\nthe ICC match officials, players, team coaches and authorised television personnel shall be allowed access \\\\nto the pitch area. Such access shall be subject to the following limitations: \\\\n6.3.2.1 Only captains and team coaches may walk on the actual playing surface of the pitch area (outside of the \\\\ncrease markings). \\\\n6.3.2.2 Access to the pitch area by television personnel shall be restricted to one camera crew (including one or \\\\ntwo television commentators) of the official licensed television broadcaster(s) (but not news crews). \\\\n6.3.2.3 No spiked footwear shall be permitted. \\\\n6.3.2.4 No one shall be permitted to bounce a ball on the pitch, strike it with a bat or cause damage to the pitch in \\\\nany other way. \\\\n6.3.2.5 Access shall not interfere with pitch preparation. \\\\n6.3.3 In the event of any dispute, the ICC Match Referee will rule and her ruling will be final. \\\\n6.4 Changing the pitch \\\\n6.4.1 If the on-field umpires decide that it is dangerous or unreasonable for play to continue on the match pitch, \\\\nthey shall stop play and immediately advise the ICC Match Referee. \\\\n6.4.2 The on-field umpires and the ICC Match Referee shall then consult with both captains. \\\\n6.4.3 If the captains agree to continue, play shall resume. \\\\n6.4.4 If the decision is not to resume play, the on-field umpires together with the ICC Match Referee shall consider \\\\nwhether the existing pitch can be repaired and the match resumed from the point it was stopped. In \\\\nconsidering whether to authorise such repairs, the ICC Match Referee must consider whether this would \\\\nplace either side at an unfair advantage, given the play that had already taken place on the dangerous pitch. \\\\n6.4.5 If the decision is that the existing pitch cannot be repaired, then the match is to be abandoned as a draw. \\\\n6.4.6 If the abandonment occurs on the first scheduled day of the match, the ICC Match Referee shall consult with \\\\nthe Home Board with the objective of finding a way for a new match (including a new nomination of teams \\\\nand toss) to commence on the same date and venue. Such a match may be played either on the repaired \\\\npitch or on another pitch, subject to the ICC Match Referee and the relevant Ground Authority both being \\\\nsatisfied that the new pitch will be of the required Test standard. The playing time lost between the \\\\nscheduled start time of the original match and the actual start time of the new match will be covered by the \\\\nprovisions of clause 12. \\\\n6.4.7 If it is not possible to start a new match on the scheduled first day of the original match, the relevant officials \\\\nfrom the participating Boards shall agree on whether the match can be replayed within the existing tour \\\\nschedule. \\\\n6.4.8 Throughout the above decision making processes, the ICC Match Referee shall keep informed both \\\\ncaptains and the head of the Ground Authority. The head of the Ground Authority shall ensure that suitable \\\\nand prompt public announcements are made. \\\\n6.5 Non-turf pitches \\\\nAll Test matches shall be played on natural turf pitches. The use of PVA and other adhesives in the preparation of \\\\npitches is not permitted. \\\\n6.6 Junior Cricket \\\\nShall not apply. \\\\n12 \\\\n7 THE CREASES \\\\n7.1 The creases \\\\nThe positions of a bowling crease, a popping crease and two return creases shall be marked by white lines, as set \\\\nout in clauses 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4, at each end of the pitch. See paragraph 1 of Appendix C. \\\\n7.2 The bowling crease \\\\nThe bowling crease, which is the back edge of the crease marking, is the line that marks the end of the pitch, as in \\\\nclause 6.1 (Area of pitch). It shall be 8 ft 8 in/2.64 m in length. \\\\n7.3 The popping crease \\\\nThe popping crease, which is the back edge of the crease marking, shall be in front of and parallel to the bowling \\\\ncrease and shall be 4 ft/1.22 m from it. The popping crease shall be marked to a minimum of 15 yards/13.71 m on \\\\neither side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps and shall be considered to be unlimited \\\\nin length. \\\\n7.4 The return creases \\\\nThe return creases, which are the inside edges of the crease markings, shall be at right angles to the popping crease \\\\nat a distance of 4 ft 4 in/1.32 m either side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps. Each \\\\nreturn crease shall be marked from the popping crease to a minimum of 8 ft/2.44 m behind it and shall be considered \\\\nto be unlimited in length. \\\\n8 THE WICKETS \\\\n8.1 Description, width and pitching \\\\nTwo sets of wickets shall be pitched opposite and parallel to each other in the centres of the bowling creases. Each \\\\nset shall be 9 in/22.86 cm wide and shall consist of three wooden stumps with two wooden bails on top. See \\\\nparagraph 2 of Appendix B. \\\\n8.2 Size of stumps \\\\nThe tops of the stumps shall be 28 in/71.12 cm above the playing surface and shall be dome shaped except for the \\\\nbail grooves. The portion of a stump above the playing surface shall be cylindrical apart from the domed top, with \\\\ncircular section of diameter not less than 1.38 in/3.50 cm nor more than 1.5 in/3.81 cm. See paragraph 2 of Appendix \\\\nB. \\\\nFor televised matches the Home Board may provide a slightly larger cylindrical stump to accommodate the stump \\\\ncamera. When the larger stump is used, all three stumps must be exactly the same size. \\\\n8.3 The bails \\\\n8.3.1 The bails, when in position on top of the stumps, \\\\n- shall not project more than 0.5 in/1.27 cm above them. \\\\n- shall fit between the stumps without forcing them out of the vertical. \\\\n8.3.2 Each bail shall conform to the following specifications (see paragraph 2 of Appendix B): \\\\nOverall length 4.31 in/10.95 cm \\\\nLength of barrel 2.13 in /5.40 cm \\\\nLonger spigot 1.38 in/3.50 cm \\\\nShorter spigot 0.81 in/2.06 cm. \\\\n8.3.3 The two spigots and the barrel shall have the same centre line. \\\\n13 \\\\n8.3.4 Devices aimed at protecting player safety by limiting the distance that a bail can travel off the stumps will be \\\\nallowed, subject to the approval of the Home Board and the ICC. \\\\n8.4 Dispensing with bails \\\\nThe umpires may agree to dispense with the use of bails, if necessary. If they so agree then no bails shall be used at \\\\neither end. The use of bails shall be resumed as soon as conditions permit. See clause 29.5 (Dispensing with bails). \\\\n8.5 LED Wickets \\\\nThe use of approved LED Wickets is permitted. Refer also to paragraphs 3.8.1.6 and 4.2 of Appendix D. \\\\n9 PREPARATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE PLAYING \\\\nAREA \\\\n9.1 Rolling \\\\nThe pitch shall not be rolled during the match except as permitted in clauses 9.1.1 and 9.1.2. \\\\n9.1.1 Frequency and duration of rolling \\\\nDuring the match the pitch may be rolled at the request of the captain of the batting side, for a period of not \\\\nmore than 7 minutes, before the start of each innings, other than the first innings of the match, and before \\\\nthe start of each subsequent day’s play. See clause 9.1.4. \\\\n9.1.2 Rolling after a delayed start \\\\nIn addition to the rolling permitted above, if, after the toss and before the first innings of the match, the start \\\\nis delayed, the captain of the batting side may request that the pitch be rolled for not more than 7 minutes. \\\\nHowever, if the umpires together agree that the delay has had no significant effect on the state of the pitch, \\\\nthey shall refuse such request for rolling of the pitch. \\\\n9.1.3 Choice of rollers \\\\nIf there is more than one roller available the captain of the batting side shall choose which one is to be used. \\\\n9.1.4 Timing of permitted rolling \\\\nThe rolling permitted (maximum 7 minutes) before play begins on any day shall be started not more than 30 \\\\nminutes before the time scheduled or rescheduled for play to begin. The captain of the batting side may, \\\\nhowever, delay the start of such rolling until not less than 10 minutes before the time scheduled or \\\\nrescheduled for play to begin. \\\\nThe following shall apply in addition to clause 9.1: \\\\n9.1.5 Prior to the scheduled time for the toss, the artificial drying of the pitch and outfield shall be at the discretion \\\\nof the Ground Authority. Thereafter and throughout the match the drying of the outfield may be undertaken \\\\nat any time by the Ground Authority, but the drying of the affected area of the pitch shall be carried out only \\\\non the instructions and under the supervision of the umpires. The umpires shall be empowered to have the \\\\npitch dried without reference to the captains at any time they are of the opinion that it is unfit for play. \\\\n9.1.6 The umpires may instruct the Ground Authority to use any available equipment, including any roller for the \\\\npurpose of drying the pitch and making it fit for play. \\\\n9.1.7 An absorbent roller may be used to remove water from the covers including the cover on the match pitch. \\\\n9.2 Clearing debris from the pitch \\\\n9.2.1 The pitch shall be cleared of any debris \\\\n14 \\\\n9.2.1.1 before the start of each day’s play. This shall be after the completion of mowing and before any rolling, not \\\\nearlier than 30 minutes nor later than 10 minutes before the time or any rescheduled time for start of play. \\\\n9.2.1.2 between innings. This shall precede rolling if any is to take place. \\\\n9.2.1.3 at all intervals for meals. \\\\n9.2.2 The clearance of debris in clause 9.2.1 shall be done by sweeping, except where the umpires consider that \\\\nthis may be detrimental to the surface of the pitch. In this case the debris must be cleared from that area by \\\\nhand, without sweeping. \\\\n9.2.3 In addition to clause 9.2.1, debris may be cleared from the pitch by hand, without sweeping, before mowing \\\\nand whenever either umpire considers it necessary. \\\\n9.3 Mowing \\\\n9.3.1 Responsibility for mowing \\\\n9.3.1.1 All mowings which are carried out before the match shall be the sole responsibility of the Ground Authority. \\\\n9.3.1.2 All subsequent mowings shall be carried out under the supervision of the umpires. \\\\n9.3.2 The pitch and outfield \\\\nIn order that throughout the match the ground conditions should be as nearly the same for both sides as \\\\npossible, both the pitch and the outfield shall be mown on each day of the match on which play is expected \\\\nto take place, if ground and weather conditions permit. \\\\nIf, for reasons other than conditions of ground or weather, complete mowing of the outfield is not possible, \\\\nthe Ground Authority shall notify the captains and umpires of the procedure to be adopted for such mowing \\\\nduring the match. \\\\n9.3.3 Timing of mowing \\\\n9.3.3.1 Mowing of the pitch on any day shall be completed not later than 30 minutes before the time scheduled or \\\\nrescheduled for play to begin on that day, before any sweeping prior to rolling. If necessary, debris may be \\\\nremoved from the pitch before mowing, by hand, without sweeping. See clause 9.2.3. \\\\n9.3.3.2 Mowing of the outfield on any day shall be completed not later than 15 minutes before the time scheduled \\\\nor rescheduled for play to begin on that day. \\\\n9.4 Watering the pitch \\\\nThe pitch shall not be watered during the match. \\\\n9.5 Re-marking creases \\\\nCreases shall be re-marked whenever either umpire considers it necessary. \\\\n9.6 Maintenance of footholes \\\\nThe umpires shall ensure that the holes made by the bowlers and batters are cleaned out and dried whenever \\\\nnecessary to facilitate play. \\\\nThe umpires shall allow, if necessary, the returfing of footholes made by the bowlers in their delivery strides, or the \\\\nuse of quick-setting fillings for the same purpose. \\\\nIn addition, the umpires shall see that wherever possible and whenever it is considered necessary, action is taken \\\\nduring all intervals in play to do whatever is practicable to improve the bowler’s footholes. As soon as possible after \\\\nthe conclusion of each day’s play, bowler’s footholes will be repaired. \\\\n9.7 Securing of footholds and maintenance of pitch \\\\nDuring play, umpires shall allow the players to secure their footholds by the use of sawdust provided that no damage \\\\nto the pitch is caused and that clause 41 (Unfair play) is not contravened. \\\\n15 \\\\n9.8 Watering the outfield \\\\nThe watering of the outfield will be permitted during the match subject to the following: \\\\n9.8.1 Such watering shall only be possible if the “watering plan” is requested by the Ground Authority and \\\\napproved by the umpires before the match has started. Once the match has started, any such request will \\\\nnot be considered. \\\\n9.8.2 The consent of the captains is not required, but the umpires shall advise both captains and the ICC Match \\\\nReferee before the start of the match on what has been agreed. \\\\n9.8.3 The watering shall occur as soon as possible after the conclusion of the day’s play. \\\\n9.8.4 The watering shall only be carried out to the extent that it is necessary to retain the good condition of the \\\\noutfield. \\\\n9.8.5 The square and bowlers’ run ups will be adequately covered prior to any watering taking place. \\\\n9.8.6 All ongoing matters of interpretation and implementation of watering requirements and regulations shall be \\\\nresolved between the umpires and Ground Authority, but with the umpires retaining ultimate discretion over \\\\nwhether to approve any watering. \\\\n9.9 Protection and preparation of adjacent pitches during matches \\\\nThe protection (by way of an appropriate cover) and preparation of pitches which are adjacent to the match pitch will \\\\nbe permitted during the match subject to the following: \\\\n9.9.1 Such measures will only be possible if requested by the Ground Authority and approved by the umpires \\\\nbefore the start of the match. \\\\n9.9.2 Approval should only be granted where such measures are unavoidable and will not compromise the safety \\\\nof the players or their ability to execute their actions with complete freedom. \\\\n9.9.3 The preparation work shall be carried out under the supervision of the reserve umpire. \\\\n9.9.4 Any necessary watering shall be carried out only to the extent necessary for such preparations and shall not \\\\nbe permitted in circumstances which may in any way affect the match pitch. \\\\n9.9.5 The consent of the captains is not required but the umpires shall advise both captains and the ICC Match \\\\nReferee before the start of the match on what has been agreed. \\\\n10 COVERING THE PITCH \\\\n10.1 Before the match \\\\nThe use of covers before the match is the responsibility of the Ground Authority and may include full covering if \\\\nrequired. \\\\nThe pitch shall be entirely protected against rain up to the commencement of play. \\\\nHowever, the Ground Authority shall grant suitable facility to the captains to inspect the pitch before the nomination of \\\\ntheir players and to the umpires to discharge their duties as laid down in clauses 2 (The umpires), 6 (The pitch), 7 \\\\n(The creases), 8 (The wickets), and 9 (Preparation and maintenance of the playing area). \\\\n10.2 During the match \\\\nThe pitch shall be entirely protected against rain up to the commencement of play each day, and for the duration of \\\\nthe period of the match. It shall be wholly covered at the termination of each day’s play or providing the weather is \\\\nfine, within a period of two hours thereafter. \\\\nThe covers must totally protect the pitch and also the pitch surroundings, to a minimum of 5 metres either side of the \\\\npitch, and any worn or soft areas in the outfield. \\\\n16 \\\\nThe bowlers’ run-ups shall be covered during inclement weather, in order to keep them dry, to a distance of at least \\\\n10 x 10 metres. \\\\n10.3 Removal of covers \\\\nAll covers (including “hessian” or “scrim” covers used to protect the pitch against the sun) shall be removed not later \\\\nthan 2 ½ hours before the scheduled start of play provided it is not raining at the time, but the pitch will be covered \\\\nagain if rain falls prior to the commencement of play. \\\\n11 INTERVALS \\\\n11.1 An interval \\\\n11.1.1 The following shall be classed as intervals. \\\\n- The period between close of play on one day and the start of the next day’s play. \\\\n- Intervals between innings. \\\\n- Intervals for meals. \\\\n- Intervals for drinks. \\\\n- Any other agreed interval. \\\\n11.1.2 Only these intervals shall be considered as scheduled breaks for the purposes of clause 24.2.6 (fielder \\\\nabsent or leaving the field of play). \\\\n11.2 Duration of intervals \\\\n11.2.1 An interval for lunch or tea shall be of the duration detailed below, taken from the call of Time before the \\\\ninterval until the call of Play on resumption after the interval. \\\\n11.2.1.1 Lunch Interval: The interval shall be of 40 minutes duration. \\\\n11.2.1.2 Tea Interval: The interval shall be of 20 minutes duration. \\\\n11.2.1.3 Home Boards, with the consent of the visiting Board, may seek the approval of the ICC to amend the \\\\nduration of these two intervals, provided the combined scheduled duration of the two intervals shall be \\\\nequal to 60 minutes. \\\\n11.2.2 An interval between innings shall be 10 minutes, commencing from the close of an innings until the call of \\\\nPlay for the start of the next innings. See, however, clauses 11.43, 11.65 and 11.76. \\\\n11.3 Allowance for interval between innings \\\\nIn addition to the provisions of clauses 11.5 and 11.6, \\\\n11.3.1 if an innings ends when 10 minutes or less remains before the time agreed for close of play, or when there \\\\nare less than 2 overs remaining to complete the minimum over requirement on any day, whichever is \\\\napplicable, there shall be no further play on that day. No change shall be made to the time for the start of \\\\nplay on the following day on account of the 10 minute interval between innings. \\\\n11.3.2 if a captain declares an innings closed during an interruption in play of more than 10 minutes duration, \\\\nprovided that at least 10 minutes remains of the interruption, no adjustment shall be made to the time for \\\\nresumption of play on account of the 10 minute interval between innings, which shall be considered as \\\\nincluded in the interruption. If less than 10 minutes remains of the interruption when the captain declares the \\\\ninnings closed, or forfeits an innings, the next innings shall commence 10 minutes after the declaration or \\\\nforfeiture is made. \\\\n11.3.3 if a captain declares an innings closed during any interval other than an interval for drinks, provided that at \\\\nleast 10 minutes remains of the interval, the interval shall be of the agreed duration and shall be considered \\\\nto include the 10 minute interval between innings. If less than 10 minutes remains of the interval when the \\\\n17 \\\\ncaptain declares the innings closed, or forfeits an innings, the interval shall be extended as necessary and \\\\nthe next innings shall commence 10 minutes after the declaration or forfeiture is made. \\\\n11.4 Changing agreed times of intervals \\\\nIf, at any time during the match, \\\\neither playing time is lost through adverse conditions of ground, weather or light or in exceptional \\\\ncircumstances, \\\\nor the players have occasion to leave the field other than at a scheduled interval, \\\\nthe time of the lunch interval or of the tea interval may be changed if the two umpires and both captains so agree, \\\\nproviding the requirements of clauses 11.2 and 11.5, 11.6,11.7 and 11.8.3 are not contravened. \\\\n11.5 Changing agreed time for lunch interval \\\\n11.5.1 If an innings ends when 10 minutes or less remains before the agreed time for lunch, the interval shall be \\\\ntaken immediately. It shall be of the agreed duration and shall be considered to include the 10 minute \\\\ninterval between innings. \\\\n11.5.2 If because of adverse conditions of ground, weather or light, or in exceptional circumstances, a stoppage \\\\noccurs when 10 minutes or less remains before the agreed time for lunch, then, whether or not agreement is \\\\nreached in the circumstances of clause 11.4, the interval shall be taken immediately. It shall be of the \\\\nagreed duration. Play shall resume at the end of this interval or as soon after as conditions permit. \\\\n11.5.3 If the players have occasion to leave the field for any reason when more than 10 minutes remains before the \\\\nagreed time for lunch then, unless the umpires and captains together agree to alter it, lunch shall be taken at \\\\nthe agreed time. \\\\n11.6 Changing agreed time for tea interval \\\\n11.6.1 If an innings ends when 30 minutes or less remains before the agreed time for tea, the interval shall be \\\\ntaken immediately. It shall be of the agreed duration and shall be considered to include the 10 minute \\\\ninterval between innings. \\\\n11.6.2 If, when 30 minutes remains before the agreed time for tea, an interval between innings is already in \\\\nprogress, play shall resume at the end of the 10 minute interval, if conditions permit. \\\\n11.6.3 If, because of adverse conditions of ground, weather or light, or in exceptional circumstances, a stoppage \\\\noccurs when 30 minutes or less remains before the agreed time for tea, then unless there is an agreement \\\\nto change the time for tea, as permitted in clause 11.4, the interval shall be taken immediately. The interval \\\\nshall be of the agreed duration. Play shall resume at the end of the interval or as soon after as conditions \\\\npermit. \\\\n11.6.4 If a stoppage is already in progress when 30 minutes remains before the agreed time for tea, clause 11.4 \\\\nshall apply. \\\\n11.7 Lunch or tea interval - 9 wickets down \\\\nFor the lunch interval and for the tea interval \\\\nIf either, 9 wickets are already down when 3 minutes remains to the scheduled time for the interval, \\\\nor, the 9th wicket falls within this 3 minutes, or at any time up to and including the final ball of the over in \\\\nprogress at the scheduled time for the interval, \\\\nthen the provisions of clause 12.5.2 shall not apply and the interval will not be taken until the end of the over that is in \\\\nprogress 30 minutes after the originally agreed time for the interval, unless the players have cause to leave the field \\\\nof play or the innings is completed earlier. \\\\n18 \\\\nHowever, if at the conclusion of this additional 30 minutes, if a small number of runs are required to win the match, \\\\nand both captains wish to continue playing in order to achieve a definite result, play will continue until either the \\\\nmatch concludes or the players have cause to leave the field for any other reason. \\\\nFor the purposes of this section of the Playing Conditions, the retirement of a batter is not to be considered equivalent \\\\nto the fall of a wicket. \\\\n11.8 Intervals for drinks \\\\n11.8.1 Drinks intervals shall be scheduled. Each interval shall be kept as short as possible and in any case shall \\\\nnot exceed 4 minutes. \\\\n11.8.1.1 There shall be one drinks interval during each session of play, scheduled at the mid-point of the session. \\\\n11.8.1.2 Under conditions of extreme heat the umpires may permit extra intervals for drinks during each session. \\\\n11.8.1.3 An individual player may be given a drink either on the boundary edge or at the fall of a wicket, on the field, \\\\nprovided that no playing time is wasted. No other drinks shall be taken onto the field without the \\\\npermission of the umpires. Any player taking drinks onto the field shall be dressed in proper cricket attire \\\\n(subject to the wearing of bibs - refer to the note in clause 24.1.4). \\\\n11.8.2 A drinks interval shall be taken at the end of the over in progress when the agreed time is reached. If, \\\\nhowever, a wicket falls or a batter retires within 5 minutes of the agreed time then drinks shall be taken \\\\nimmediately. \\\\nNo other variation in the timing of drinks intervals shall be permitted except as provided for in clause 11.8.3. \\\\n11.8.3 If an innings ends or the players have to leave the field of play for any other reason within 30 minutes of the \\\\nagreed time for a drinks interval, the umpires and captains together may rearrange the timing of drinks \\\\nintervals in that session. \\\\n11.8.4 Intervals for drinks may not be taken during the last hour of the match, as defined in clause 12.6 (Last hour \\\\nof match - number of overs). Subject to this limitation, the captains and umpires shall agree the times for \\\\nsuch intervals, if any, before the toss and on each subsequent day not later than 10 minutes before play is \\\\nscheduled to start. \\\\n11.9 Agreement to forgo intervals \\\\nAt any time during the match, the captains may agree to forgo any of the drinks intervals. The umpires shall be \\\\ninformed of the decision. \\\\nWhen play is in progress, the batters at the wicket may deputise for their captain in making an agreement to forgo a \\\\ndrinks interval in that session. \\\\n11.10 Scorers to be informed \\\\nThe umpires shall ensure that the scorers are informed of all agreements about hours of play and intervals and of any \\\\nchanges made thereto as permitted under this clause. \\\\n12 START OF PLAY; CESSATION OF PLAY \\\\n12.1 Call of Play \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall call Play before the first ball of the match and on the resumption of play after any \\\\ninterval or interruption. \\\\n12.2 Call of Time \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall call Time, when the ball is dead, at the end of any session of play or as required by \\\\nthese Playing Conditions. See also clause 20.3 (Call of Over or Time). \\\\n19 \\\\n12.3 Removal of bails \\\\nAfter the call of Time, the bails shall be removed from both wickets. \\\\n12.4 Starting a new over \\\\nAnother over shall always be started at any time during the match, unless an interval is to be taken in the \\\\ncircumstances set out in clause 12.5.2, if the umpire, walking at normal pace, has arrived at the position behind the \\\\nstumps at the bowler’s end before the time agreed for the next interval, or for the close of play, has been reached. \\\\n12.5 Completion of an over \\\\nOther than at the end of the match, \\\\n12.5.1 if the agreed time for an interval is reached during an over, the over shall be completed before the interval is \\\\ntaken, except as provided for in clause 12.5.2. \\\\n12.5.2 when less than 3 minutes remains before the time agreed for the next interval, the interval shall be taken \\\\nimmediately if: \\\\neither a batter is dismissed or retires; or \\\\n the players have occasion to leave the field, \\\\nwhether this occurs during an over or at the end of an over. Except at the end of an innings, if an over is \\\\nthus interrupted it shall be completed on the resumption of play. \\\\n12.6 Conclusion of match \\\\n12.6.1 The match is concluded \\\\n12.6.1.1 as soon as a result as defined in clauses 16.1 to 16.5 (The result) is reached. \\\\n12.6.1.2 as soon as both \\\\nthe minimum number of overs for the last hour are completed \\\\nand the agreed time for close of play is reached, \\\\nunless a result is reached earlier. \\\\n12.6.2 The match is concluded if, without a conclusion having been reached under 12.6.1, the players leave the \\\\nfield for adverse conditions of ground, weather or light, or in exceptional circumstances, and no further play \\\\nis possible. \\\\n12.7 Hours of Play; Minimum Overs Requirement \\\\nThe Home Board shall determine the hours of play, subject to there being 6 hours scheduled play per day, and \\\\nsubject to: \\\\n12.7.1 Minimum Overs in the Day \\\\nSubject to clause 12.7.2 below: \\\\n20 \\\\n12.7.1.1 On days other than the last day, play shall continue on each day until the completion of a minimum target \\\\nof 100 overs (or a minimum of 17 overs per hour) or the completion of the scheduled or rescheduled \\\\ncessation time, whichever is the later but provided that play shall not continue for more than 30 minutes \\\\nbeyond the scheduled or rescheduled cessation time (permitted overtime). For the sake of clarity, if any of \\\\nthe minimum target number of overs have not been bowled at the completion of the permitted overtime, \\\\nplay shall cease upon completion of the over in progress. The overs not bowled shall not be made up on \\\\nany subsequent day. \\\\n12.7.1.2 On the last day, a minimum of 83 overs (or a minimum of 17 overs per hour) shall be bowled during the \\\\nplaying time other than the last hour of the match where clause 12.7.6 below shall apply. If any of the \\\\nminimum of 83 overs, or as recalculated, have not been bowled when one hour of the scheduled playing \\\\ntime remains, the last hour of the match for the purposes of clause 12.7.6 shall be the hour immediately \\\\nfollowing the completion of these overs. \\\\n12.7.2 Reduction in minimum overs \\\\nExcept in the last hour of the match, for which clause 12.7.6 makes provision, if play is suspended due to \\\\nadverse weather or light or any other reason (other than normal intervals) for more than 1 hour on any day, \\\\nthe minimum number of overs shall be reduced by 1 over for each full 3.52 minutes of the aggregate playing \\\\ntime lost. For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate of 1 hour shall be inclusive of any time that may have \\\\nbeen brought forward from previous days due to playing time lost on such previous days under clause 0 \\\\nbelow. \\\\n12.7.3 Making Up Lost Time \\\\n12.7.3.1 On The Day \\\\nSubject to weather and light, except in the last hour of the match, in the event of play being \\\\nsuspended for any reason other than normal intervals, the playing time on that day shall be \\\\nextended by the amount of time lost up to a maximum of 1 hour. For the avoidance of doubt, the \\\\nmaximum of 1 hour shall be inclusive of any time that may have been added to the scheduled \\\\nplaying time due to playing time having been lost on previous days under clause 0 below. \\\\n12.7.3.2 On Subsequent Days \\\\nIf any time is lost and cannot be made up under clause 12.7.3 above, additional time of up to a \\\\nmaximum of 30 minutes per day shall be added to the scheduled playing hours for the next day, \\\\nand subsequent day(s) as required (to make up as much lost time as possible). Where \\\\nappropriate this additional time shall be added prior to the scheduled start of the first session. In \\\\ncircumstances where it is not possible to add this additional time prior to the scheduled start of \\\\nthe first session, the additional time may be added to the second and/or the third sessions (see \\\\nalso clause 12.7.4). When such additional time is added, the minimum overs for that day shall be \\\\nincreased by one over for each four minutes of additional time or part thereof. \\\\n12.7.3.3 On the Last Day only (refer to Appendix E) \\\\nClause 12.7.3 applies. However, for the purposes of this clause, the definition of playing time \\\\nshall exclude the last hour. No time is made up in respect of any interruptions that commence \\\\nafter the start of the last hour. \\\\nShould play be interrupted prior to the last hour being signalled, the playing time lost will be \\\\nmade up (subject to the maximum of 1 hour described in (a) above) with the previously \\\\nscheduled time for the last hour being updated to reflect the time made up during this \\\\ninterruption. \\\\nIn order to determine the minimum overs to be bowled prior to the last hour and the rescheduled \\\\nstarting time for the last hour, it is necessary to complete the template in Appendix E. \\\\n12.7.3.4     For Day/Night Test matches, the participating teams may agree on the following: \\\\n- The maximum amount of make-up time to be used on the day up to no more than 1 hour; \\\\n- The maximum make-up time to be added to subsequent days up to no more than 30 minutes \\\\nper day; and \\\\n21 \\\\n- When the make-up time is to be allocated across subsequent days. \\\\n12.7.4 Change of Intervals \\\\n12.7.4.1 If play has been suspended for any reason other than normal intervals for 30 minutes or more prior to the \\\\ncommencement of the scheduled or rescheduled tea interval on that day, the tea interval shall be delayed \\\\nfor 30 minutes. \\\\n12.7.4.2 Notwithstanding the provisions of clause 12.7.4.1above, the timings of intervals can be altered under \\\\nclause 11.4 at any time on any day if playing time has been lost irrespective of whether the time has been \\\\nlost on that day or on any previous days. \\\\n12.7.5 Change of Innings \\\\nWhere there is a change of innings during a day’s play (except where the change of innings occurs at lunch or tea or \\\\nwhen play is suspended for any reason) 2 overs will be deducted from the minimum number of overs to be bowled. \\\\nThe over in progress at the end of an innings is regarded as a completed over for the purposes of determining the \\\\nminimum number of remaining overs to be bowled in the day, except when the change of innings occurs in the last \\\\nhour of the match (see clause 12.12.3). \\\\n12.7.6 Last Hour \\\\nA minimum of 17 overs shall be bowled in the last hour and all calculations with regard to suspensions of \\\\nplay or the start of a new innings shall be based on 1 over for each full 3.52 minutes (refer to clause 12.7.9 \\\\nbelow). \\\\nOn the final day, if both captains (the batters at the wicket may act for their captain) accept that there is no \\\\nprospect of either side achieving a victory, they may agree to finish the match after (a) the time for the \\\\ncommencement of the last hour has been reached OR (b) there are a minimum of 17 overs to be bowled, \\\\nwhichever is the later. \\\\n12.7.7 Notwithstanding any other provision, there shall be no further play on any day, other than the last day, if a \\\\nwicket falls or a batter retires or if the players have occasion to leave the field during the last minimum over \\\\nwithin 2 minutes of the scheduled cessation time or thereafter. This shall also apply to the additional time \\\\npermitted in order to complete the minimum over requirement for the day. If an over is interrupted in these \\\\ncircumstances stumps shall be drawn for the day and the over shall be completed on the resumption of play. \\\\n12.7.8 An over completed on resumption of a new day’s play shall be disregarded in calculating minimum overs for \\\\nthat day. \\\\n12.7.9 Stumps Drawn \\\\nExcept on the final day: \\\\n12.7.9.1 In the event of play being suspended for any reason at or after the most recently scheduled or rescheduled \\\\ncessation time, stumps shall be drawn upon play being suspended. \\\\n12.7.9.2 In the event of the players already being off the field for a suspension of play at the most recently \\\\nrescheduled cessation time, then stumps will be drawn at that time. \\\\n12.7.10 The scoreboard shall show: \\\\n12.7.10.1 the total number of overs bowled with the ball currently in use: and \\\\n12.7.10.2 the minimum number of overs remaining to be bowled in a day. \\\\n12.7.11 Penalties shall apply for slow over rates (refer to the ICC Code of Conduct and see clause 12.9 below). \\\\n12.7.12 Day-Night Tests \\\\nHome Boards may, prior to the commencement of a Test, and with the agreement of the Visiting Board, \\\\nseek the approval of the ICC to play the match as a day/night Test. In such a case the hours of play shall be \\\\ndetermined by agreement between the Home Board and the Visiting Board subject to there being 6 hours \\\\nscheduled play per day. \\\\n22 \\\\n12.8 Extra Time \\\\n12.8.1 At the End of the Day \\\\nThe umpires may decide to play 30 minutes (a minimum of 9 overs) extra time at the end of any day (other \\\\nthan the last day) if requested by either captain if, in the umpires opinion, it would bring about a definite \\\\nresult on that day. This is in addition to the additional time provided for in clause 12.7.3 above. If the umpires \\\\ndo not believe a result can be achieved no extra time shall be allowed. \\\\nIf it is decided to play such extra time on one or more of these days, the whole period shall be played out \\\\neven though the possibility of finishing the match may have disappeared before the full period has expired. \\\\nIf at the conclusion of this extra time, a small number of runs are required to win the match and both \\\\ncaptains wish to continue playing in order to achieve a definite result on that day, play will continue until \\\\neither the match concludes or the players have cause to leave the field for any other reason. \\\\nOnly the actual amount of playing time up to the maximum 30 minutes extra time by which play is extended \\\\non any day shall be deducted from the total number of hours of play remaining, and the match shall end \\\\nearlier on the final day by the amount of time by which play was previously extended under this clause. \\\\n12.8.2 At the Lunch or Tea Interval \\\\nThe umpires may decide to extend play by 15 minutes (a minimum of four overs) at the scheduled lunch or \\\\ntea interval of any day if requested by either captain if, in the umpires’ opinion, it would bring about a definite \\\\nresult in that session. If the umpires do not believe a result can be achieved no extra time shall be allowed. \\\\nIf it is decided to extend play, the whole period shall be played out even though the possibility of finishing the \\\\nmatch may have disappeared before the full period has expired. \\\\nIf at the conclusion of this extra time, a small number of runs are required to win the match and both \\\\ncaptains wish to continue playing in order to achieve a definite result prior to the scheduled interval, play will \\\\ncontinue until either the match concludes or the players have cause to leave the field for any other reason. \\\\nThe following session of play shall be reduced by the amount of time by which play was previously extended \\\\nunder this clause. \\\\n12.8.3 For the avoidance of doubt, clause 11.7 shall still apply subsequent to the application of this clause, i.e when \\\\n9 wickets are down following the extra 15 minutes. However, this clause shall not apply when clause 11.7 \\\\nhas already been applied, i.e. the 15 minutes shall not be added at the end of 30 minutes extra time. \\\\n12.9 Minimum Over Rates \\\\n12.9.1 The minimum over rate to be achieved in Test Matches shall be 17 overs per hour. \\\\n12.9.2 The actual over rate shall be calculated at the end of the match by the umpires and shall be the average rate \\\\nwhich is achieved by the fielding team across both of the batting team’s innings. \\\\n12.9.3 In calculating the actual over rate for the match, allowances will be given as follows: \\\\n23 \\\\n12.9.3.1 The time lost as a result of treatment given to a player by an authorised medical personnel on the field of \\\\nplay; \\\\n12.9.3.2 The time lost as a result of a player being required to leave the field as a result of a serious injury; \\\\n12.9.3.3 The time taken for all third umpire referrals and consultations and any umpire or player reviews; \\\\n12.9.3.4 The time lost as a result of time wasting by the batting side; and \\\\n12.9.3.5 The time lost due to all other circumstances that are beyond the control of the fielding side. \\\\n12.9.3.6 2 minutes per wicket taken, provided that such wicket results in the subsequent batters immediately \\\\ncommencing her innings. For the avoidance of any doubt, no time allowance will be given for the final \\\\nwicket of an innings or where a wicket falls immediately prior to any interval; \\\\n12.9.3.7 4 minutes per drinks break taken (one per session). \\\\nIn the event of any time allowances being granted to the fielding team under clause 12.9.3.4 above (time wasting by \\\\nbatting team), then such time shall be deducted from the allowances granted to such batting team in the \\\\ndetermination of its over rate. \\\\nIf a batting team is bowled out in 3 ½ hours or less (taking into account all of the time allowances set out above) in \\\\nany particular innings, and the fielding team was unable to maintain the minimum over requirement during that \\\\ninnings, no account will be taken of the actual over rate in that innings when calculating the actual over rate at the \\\\nend of the match. \\\\nThe current over rate of the fielding team (+/- overs compared to the minimum rate required), to be advised by the \\\\nthird umpire every 30 minutes as a minimum, shall be displayed on a scoreboard or replay screen. \\\\n12.10 Last hour of match - number of overs \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall indicate the commencement of this 17 overs to the players and to the scorers. The \\\\nperiod of play thereafter shall be referred to as the last hour, whatever its actual duration. \\\\nDuring an uninterrupted last hour, play will continue until the end of the over in progress when 60 minutes have been \\\\nplayed, or until 17 overs have been bowled, whichever is later. \\\\n12.11 Last hour of match - interruptions of play \\\\nIf there is an interruption in play during the last hour of the match, the minimum number of overs to be bowled shall \\\\nbe reduced from 17 as follows: \\\\n12.11.1 The time lost for an interruption is counted from the call of Time until the time for resumption as decided by \\\\nthe umpires. \\\\n12.11.2 One over shall be deducted for every complete 3.52 minutes of time lost. \\\\n12.11.3 In the case of more than one such interruption, the minutes lost shall not be aggregated; the calculation shall \\\\nbe made for each interruption separately. \\\\n12.11.4 If, when one hour of Playing time remains, an interruption is already in progress \\\\n12.11.4.1 only the time lost after this moment shall be counted in the calculation. \\\\n12.11.4.2 the over in progress at the start of the interruption shall be completed on resumption and shall not count as \\\\none of the minimum number of overs to be bowled. \\\\n12.11.5 If, after the start of the last hour, an interruption occurs during an over, the over shall be completed on \\\\nresumption of play. The two part-overs shall between them count as one over of the minimum number to be \\\\nbowled. \\\\n12.12 Last hour of match - intervals between innings \\\\nIf an innings ends so that a new innings is to be started during the last hour of the match, the interval starts with the \\\\nend of the innings and is to end 10 minutes later. \\\\n24 \\\\n12.12.1 If this interval is already in progress at the start of the last hour then, to determine the number of overs to be \\\\nbowled in the new innings, calculations are to be made as set out in clause 12.11. \\\\n12.12.2 If the innings ends after the last hour has started, two calculations are to be made, as set out in clauses \\\\n12.12.3 and 12.12.4. The greater of the numbers yielded by these two calculations is to be the minimum \\\\nnumber of overs to be bowled in the new innings. \\\\n12.12.3 Calculation based on overs remaining: \\\\n- At the conclusion of the innings, the number of overs that remain to be bowled, of the minimum in the last \\\\nhour, to be noted. \\\\n- If this is not a whole number it is to be rounded up to the next whole number. \\\\n- Two overs, for the interval, to be deducted from the resulting number to determine the number of overs still \\\\nto be bowled. \\\\n12.12.4 Calculation based on time remaining: \\\\n- At the conclusion of the innings, the time remaining until the agreed time for close of play to be noted. \\\\n- 10 minutes, for the interval, to be deducted from this time to determine the Playing time remaining. \\\\n- A calculation to be made of one over for every complete 4 minutes of the Playing time remaining, plus one \\\\nmore over if a further part of 4 minutes remains. \\\\n12.13 Completion of last over of match \\\\nThe over in progress at the close of play on the final day shall be completed unless \\\\neither a result has been reached; or \\\\n the players have occasion to leave the field. In this case there shall be no resumption of play except in the \\\\ncircumstances of clause 16.7 (Mistakes in scoring) and the match shall be at an end. \\\\n12.14 Bowler unable to complete an over during last hour of match \\\\nIf, for any reason, a bowler is unable to complete an over during the last hour, clause 17.8 (Bowler incapacitated or \\\\nsuspended during an over) shall apply. The separate parts of such an over shall count as one over of the minimum to \\\\nbe bowled. \\\\n \\\\n13 INNINGS \\\\n13.1 Number of innings \\\\n13.1.1 A match shall be two innings for each side. \\\\n13.2 Alternate innings \\\\nEach side shall take their innings alternately except in the cases provided for in clause 14 (The follow-on) or in clause \\\\n15.2 (Forfeiture of an innings).  \\\\n13.3 Completed innings \\\\nA side’s innings is to be considered as completed if any of the following applies \\\\n13.3.1 the side is all out. \\\\n13.3.2 at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batter is \\\\navailable to come in. \\\\n13.3.3 the captain declares the innings closed. \\\\n25 \\\\n13.3.4 the captain forfeits the innings. \\\\n13.4 The toss \\\\nThe captains shall toss a coin for the choice of innings, on the field of play and under the supervision of the ICC \\\\nMatch Referee, not earlier than 30 minutes, nor later than 15 minutes before the scheduled or any rescheduled time \\\\nfor the start of play.

Once notified, the decision cannot be changed. \\\\n13.6 Duration of Match \\\\nMatches shall be of four or five days scheduled duration. The Home Board and the Visiting Board may agree to: \\\\n13.6.1 Provide for a rest day during the match, and/or a reserve day after the scheduled days of play. \\\\n13.6.2 Play on any scheduled rest day, conditions and circumstances permitting, should a full day’s play be lost on \\\\nany day prior to the rest day. \\\\n13.6.3 Play on any scheduled reserve day, conditions and circumstances permitting, should a full day’s play be lost \\\\non any day.

Once notified, the \\\\ndecision cannot be changed. \\\\n14.3 First day’s play lost \\\\nIf no play takes place on the first day of a match, 14.1 shall apply in accordance with the number of days remaining \\\\nfrom the start of play. The day on which play first commences shall count as a whole day for this purpose, \\\\nirrespective of the time at which play starts. \\\\n26 \\\\nPlay will have taken place as soon as, after the call of Play, the first over has started. See clause 17.2 (Start of an \\\\nover). \\\\n15 DECLARATION AND FORFEITURE \\\\n15.1 Time of declaration \\\\nThe captain of the side batting may declare an innings closed, when the ball is dead, at any time during the innings. . \\\\nA declared innings shall be considered to be a completed innings. \\\\n15.2 Forfeiture of an innings \\\\nA captain may forfeit either of her side’s innings at any time before the commencement of that innings. A forfeited \\\\ninnings shall be considered to be a completed innings. \\\\n15.3 Notification \\\\nA captain shall notify the opposing captain and the umpires of any decision to declare or to forfeit an innings.

See clause 13.3 (Completed innings). Note also clause 16.4 (Winning hit or extras). \\\\n16.2 ICC Match Referee awarding a match \\\\n16.2.1 A match shall be lost by a side which either \\\\n16.2.1.1 concedes defeat or \\\\n16.2.1.2 in the opinion of the ICC Match Referee refuses to play and the ICC Match Referee shall award the match \\\\nto the other side. \\\\n16.2.2 If an umpire considers that an action by any player or players might constitute a refusal by either side to play \\\\nthen the umpires together shall inform the ICC Match Referee of this fact. The ICC Match Referee shall \\\\ntogether with the umpires ascertain the cause of the action. If the ICC Match Referee, after due consultation \\\\nwith the umpires, then decides that this action does constitute a refusal to play by one side, he/she shall so \\\\ninform the captain of that side. If the captain persists in the action the ICC Match Referee shall award the \\\\nmatch in accordance with clause 16.2.1.2 above. \\\\n16.2.3 If action as in clause 16.2.2 above takes place after play has started and does not constitute a refusal to \\\\nplay: \\\\n16.2.3.1 Playing time lost shall be counted from the start of the action until play recommences, subject to intervals \\\\n(clause 11) and suspensions of play (clause 2.8). \\\\n16.2.3.2 the time for close of play on that day shall be extended by this length of time, subject to clause 2.8 \\\\n(Suspension of play in dangerous and unreasonable conditions) and the provisions of clause 12.7. \\\\n16.2.3.3 if applicable, no overs shall be deducted during the last hour of the match solely on account of this time. \\\\nIn addition to the consequences of any refusal to play prescribed under this clause, any such refusal, \\\\nwhether temporary or final, may result in disciplinary action being taken against the captain and team \\\\nresponsible under the ICC Code of Conduct. \\\\n16.3 All other matches - A Tie or Draw \\\\n16.3.1 A Tie \\\\nThe result of a match shall be a Tie when all innings have been completed and the scores are equal. \\\\n27 \\\\n16.3.2 A Draw \\\\nThe result of a match shall be a Draw when it is not determined in any of the ways stated in clauses 16.1, \\\\n16.2 or 16.3.1. \\\\n16.4 Winning hit or extras \\\\n16.4.1 As soon as a result is reached as defined in clauses 16.1, 16.2 or 16.3.1, the match is at an end. Nothing \\\\nthat happens thereafter, except as in clause 41.17 (Penalty runs), shall be regarded as part of it. Note also \\\\nclause 16.7. \\\\n16.4.2 The side batting last will have scored enough runs to win only if its total of runs is sufficient without including \\\\nany runs completed by the batters before the completion of a catch, or the obstruction of a catch, from which \\\\nthe striker could be dismissed. \\\\n16.4.3 If a boundary is scored before the batters have completed sufficient runs to win the match, the whole of the \\\\nboundary allowance shall be credited to the side’s total and, in the case of a hit by the bat, to the striker’s \\\\nscore. \\\\n16.5 Statement of result \\\\nIf the side batting last wins the match without losing all its wickets, the result shall be stated as a win by the number of \\\\nwickets still then to fall. \\\\nIf, without having scored a total of runs in excess of the total scored by the opposing side, the innings of the side \\\\nbatting last has been completed, but as the result of an award of 5 Penalty runs its total of runs is then sufficient to \\\\nwin, the result shall be stated as a win to that side by Penalty runs. \\\\nIf the side fielding last wins the match, the result shall be stated as a win by runs. \\\\nIf the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as Match \\\\nConceded or Match Awarded, as the case may be. \\\\n16.6 Correctness of result \\\\nAny decision as to the correctness of the scores shall be the responsibility of the umpires. See clause 2.15 \\\\n(Correctness of scores). \\\\n16.7 Mistakes in scoring \\\\nIf, after the players and umpires have left the field in the belief that the match has been concluded, the umpires \\\\ndiscover that a mistake in scoring has occurred which affects the result then, subject to clause 16.8, they shall adopt \\\\nthe following procedure. \\\\n16.7.1 If, when the players leave the field, the side batting last has not completed its innings and: \\\\neither the number of overs to be bowled in the last hour, or in that innings, has not been completed; \\\\nor \\\\nthe agreed time for close of play, or for the end of the innings, has not been reached, \\\\nthen, unless one side concedes defeat, the umpires shall order play to resume. \\\\nUnless a result is reached sooner, play will then continue, if conditions permit, until the prescribed number of \\\\novers has been completed and either time for close of play has been reached or the allotted time for the \\\\ninnings has expired, as appropriate. The number of overs and time remaining shall be taken as they were at \\\\nthe call of Time for the supposed conclusion of the match. No account shall be taken of the time between \\\\nthat moment and the resumption of play. \\\\n16.7.2 If, at this call of Time, the overs have been completed and no Playing time remains, or if the side batting last \\\\nhas completed its innings, the umpires shall immediately inform both captains of the necessary corrections \\\\nto the scores and to the result. \\\\n28 \\\\n16.8 Result not to be changed \\\\nOnce the umpires have agreed with the scorers the correctness of the scores at the conclusion of the match - see \\\\nclauses 2.15 (Correctness of scores) and 3.2 (Correctness of scores) - the result cannot thereafter be changed. \\\\n17 THE OVER \\\\n17.1 Number of balls \\\\nThe ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 valid balls. \\\\n17.2 Start of an over \\\\nAn over has started when the bowler starts her run-up or, if there is no run-up, starts her action for the first delivery of \\\\nthat over. \\\\n17.3 Validity of balls \\\\n17.3.1 A ball shall not count as one of the 6 balls of the over unless it is delivered, even though, as in clause38.3  \\\\n(Non-striker leaving her ground early) a batter may be dismissed or some other incident occurs without the \\\\nball having been delivered. \\\\n17.3.2 A ball delivered by the bowler shall not count as one of the 6 balls of the over \\\\n17.3.2.1 if it is called dead, or is to be considered dead, before the striker has had an opportunity to play it. See \\\\nclause 20.7 (Dead ball; ball counting as one of over). \\\\n17.3.2.2 if it is called dead in the circumstances of clause 20.4.2.5.

See clause 22 (Wide ball). \\\\n17.3.2.5 when any of clauses 24.4 (Player returning without permission), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 41.4 (Deliberate \\\\nattempt to distract striker), or 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter) is applied. \\\\n17.3.3 Any deliveries other than those listed in clauses 17.3.1 and 17.3.2 shall be known as valid balls. Only valid \\\\nballs shall count towards the 6 balls of the over. \\\\n17.4 Call of Over \\\\nWhen 6 valid balls have been bowled and when the ball becomes dead, the umpire shall call Over before leaving the \\\\nwicket. See also clause 20.3 (Call of Over or Time). \\\\n17.5 Umpire miscounting \\\\n17.5.1 If the umpire miscounts the number of valid balls, the over as counted by the umpire shall stand. \\\\n17.5.2 If, having miscounted, the umpire allows an over to continue after 6 valid balls have been bowled, he/she \\\\nmay subsequently call Over when the ball becomes dead after any delivery, even if that delivery is not a \\\\nvalid ball. \\\\n17.5.3 Whenever possible, the third umpire shall liaise with the scorers and if possible inform the on-field umpires if \\\\nthe over has been miscounted. \\\\n17.6 Bowler changing ends \\\\nA bowler shall be allowed to change ends as often as desired, provided she does not bowl two overs consecutively, \\\\nnor bowl parts of each of two consecutive overs, in the same innings. \\\\n29 \\\\n17.7 Finishing an over \\\\n17.7.1 Other than at the end of an innings, a bowler shall finish an over in progress unless incapacitated or \\\\nsuspended under these Playing Conditions. \\\\n17.7.2 If for any reason, other than the end of an innings, an over is left uncompleted at the start of an interval or \\\\ninterruption, it shall be completed on resumption of play. \\\\n17.8 Bowler incapacitated or suspended during an over \\\\nIf for any reason a bowler is incapacitated while running up to deliver the first ball of an over, or is incapacitated or \\\\nsuspended during an over, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball.

See clause 18.6. \\\\n18.2 Runs disallowed and runs not scored \\\\nWherever in these Playing Conditions provision is made for the scoring of runs or awarding of penalties, such runs \\\\nand penalties will be subject to any provisions that may be applicable for a run to be disallowed or a run not to be \\\\nscored (see Appendix A 11)  or for the non-award of penalties. \\\\nWhen runs are disallowed, the one run penalty for No ball or Wide shall stand and 5 run penalties shall be allowed, \\\\nexcept for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side). \\\\n18.3 Short runs \\\\n18.3.1 A run is short if a batter fails to make good her ground in turning for a further run. \\\\n18.3.2 Although a short run shortens the succeeding one, the latter if completed shall not be regarded as short. A \\\\nstriker setting off for the first run from in front of the popping crease may do so also without penalty. \\\\n18.4 Unintentional short runs \\\\nExcept in the circumstances of clause 18.5, \\\\n18.4.1 if either batter runs a short run, the umpire concerned shall, unless a boundary is scored, call and signal \\\\nShort run as soon as the ball becomes dead and that run shall not be scored. For televised matches, in \\\\naccordance with Paragraph 2.5 of Appendix D, the third umpire shall review any call of Short run and \\\\ncommunicate his/her decision to the relevant on-field umpire. \\\\n18.4.2 if, after either or both batters run short, a boundary is scored the umpire concerned shall disregard the short \\\\nrunning and shall not call or signal Short run, unless the boundary is a result of an overthrow or wilful act of \\\\na fielder (see clause 19.8 - Overthrow or wilful act of fielder). \\\\n18.4.3 if both batters run short in one and the same run, this shall be regarded as only one short run. \\\\n18.4.4 if more than one run is short then, subject to clauses 18.4.2 and 18.4.3, all runs called as short shall not be \\\\nscored. \\\\n30 \\\\n18.4.5 if there has been more than one short run, the umpire shall inform the scorers as to the number of runs to be \\\\nrecorded. \\\\n18.5 Deliberate short runs \\\\n18.5.1 If either umpire considers that one or both batters deliberately ran short at that umpire’s end, the umpire \\\\nconcerned shall, when the ball is dead, call and signal Short run and inform the other umpire of what has \\\\noccurred and apply clause 18.5.2. \\\\n18.5.2 The bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side; \\\\n- return any not out batter to her original end; \\\\n- signal No ball or Wide to the scorers, if applicable; \\\\n- repeat the Short run signal to the scorers \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side; \\\\n- award any other 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective \\\\nhelmets belonging to the fielding side); \\\\n- inform the scorers as to the number of runs to be recorded; and \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the \\\\nreason for this action. \\\\n18.6 Runs awarded for penalties \\\\nRuns shall be awarded for penalties under clauses 18.5 (Deliberate short runs), 21 (No ball), 22 (Wide ball), 24.4 \\\\n(Player returning without permission), 26.4 (Penalties for contravention), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 28.3 (Protective \\\\nhelmets belonging to the fielding side), 41 (Unfair play) and 42 (Players’ conduct).

Note however the provisions of clauses 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded) and 28.3 (Protective helmets \\\\nbelonging to the fielding side). \\\\n31 \\\\nAdditionally the batting side shall be credited with all runs completed by the batters before the incident or call of Dead \\\\nball and the run in progress if the batters had already crossed at the instant of the incident or call of Dead ball. Note \\\\nspecifically, however, the provisions of clause 41.5.8 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter). \\\\n18.10 Crediting of runs scored \\\\nUnless stated otherwise in these Playing Conditions, \\\\n18.10.1 if the ball is struck by the bat, all runs scored by the batting side shall be credited to the striker, except for \\\\nthe following: \\\\n- an award of 5 Penalty runs, which shall be scored as Penalty runs \\\\n- the one run penalty for a No ball, which shall be scored as a No ball extra. \\\\n18.10.2 if the ball is not struck by the bat, runs shall be scored as Penalty runs, Byes, Leg byes, No ball extras or \\\\nWides as the case may be. If Byes or Leg byes accrue from a No ball, only the one run penalty for No ball \\\\nshall be scored as such, and the remainder as Byes or Leg byes as appropriate. \\\\n18.10.3 the bowler shall be debited with: \\\\n- all runs scored by the striker \\\\n- all runs scored as No ball extras \\\\n- all runs scored as Wides. \\\\n18.11 Batter returning to original end \\\\n18.11.1 When the striker is dismissed in any of the circumstances in clauses 18.11.1.1 to18.11.17, the not out batter \\\\nshall return to her original end. \\\\n18.11.1.1 Bowled. \\\\n18.11.1.2 Stumped. \\\\n18.11.1.3 Hit the ball twice. \\\\n18.11.1.4 LBW. \\\\n18.11.1.5 Hit wicket. \\\\n18.11.1.6 Caught \\\\n18.11.1.7 Obstructing the field, where the obstruction or distraction prevents the striker being out caught. \\\\n18.11.2 The batters shall return to their original ends in any of the cases of clauses 18.11.2.1 to 18.11.2.3. \\\\n18.11.2.1 A boundary is scored unless as a result of an overthrow or wilful act of a fielder (see clause 19.8). \\\\n18.11.2.2 Runs are disallowed for any reason. \\\\n18.11.2.3 the batters at the wicket decide to do so, under clause 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or \\\\nobstruction of batter). \\\\n18.12 Batter returning to wicket she has left \\\\n18.12.1 When a batter is dismissed in any of the ways in clauses 18.12.1.1 to18.12.1.2, the not out batter shall \\\\nreturn to the wicket she has left but only if the batters had not already crossed at the instant of the incident \\\\ncausing the dismissal. If runs are to be disallowed, however, the not out batter shall return to her original \\\\nend. \\\\n32 \\\\nCaught \\\\n18.12.1.1 Obstructing the field where the obstruction or distraction does not prevent the striker being out Caught. \\\\n18.12.1.2 Run out. \\\\n18.12.2 If, while a run is in progress, the ball becomes dead for any reason other than the dismissal of a batter, the \\\\nbatters shall return to the wickets they had left, but only if they had not already crossed in running when the \\\\nball became dead. If, however, any of the circumstances of clauses 18.11.2.1 to 18.11.2.3 apply, the batters \\\\nshall return to their original ends. \\\\n19 BOUNDARIES \\\\n19.1 Determining the boundary of the field of play \\\\n19.1.1 Before the toss, the umpires shall determine the boundary of the field of play, which shall be fixed for the \\\\nduration of the match. See clause 2.3.4 (Consultation with Home Board). \\\\n19.1.2 The boundary shall be determined such that no part of any sight-screen, will, at any stage of the match, be \\\\nwithin the field of play. \\\\n19.1.3 With respect to the size of the boundaries, no boundary shall be longer than 70 yards (64 meters), and no \\\\nboundary should be shorter than 60 yards (54.86 metres) from the centre of the pitch to be used. \\\\n19.1.4 Any ground on which a Test or ODI International has been played prior to 1 October 2005 which cannot \\\\nconform to these minimum dimensions shall be exempt from this playing condition. Any new ground must \\\\nconform to these minimum dimensions. \\\\n19.2 Identifying and marking the boundary \\\\n19.2.1 All boundaries must be designated by a rope, or similar object of a minimum standard as authorised by the \\\\nICC from time to time. The rope should be positioned a required minimum distance (3 yards (2.74 metres) \\\\nminimum) inside the perimeter fencing or advertising signs, or from any solid object located between the \\\\nrope and the fence/signs. For grounds with a large playing area, the maximum length of boundary should be \\\\nused before applying the minimum 3 yards (2.74 metres) between the boundary and the fence. \\\\n19.2.2 If the boundary is marked by means of an object that is in contact with the ground the boundary will be the \\\\nedge of the grounded part of the object which is nearest the pitch. \\\\n19.2.3 An obstacle within the field of play shall not be regarded as a boundary unless so determined by the umpires \\\\nbefore the toss. See clause 2.3.4 (Consultation with Home Board). \\\\n19.2.4 If an unauthorized person enters the playing arena and handles the ball, the umpire at the bowler’s end shall \\\\nbe the sole judge of whether the boundary allowance should be scored or the ball be treated as still in play \\\\nor called dead ball if a batter is liable to be out as a result of the unauthorized person handling the ball. See \\\\nalso clause 20.4.2.12 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball). \\\\n19.3 Restoring the boundary \\\\nIf a solid object used to mark the boundary is disturbed for any reason, then: \\\\n19.3.1 the boundary shall be considered to be in its original position. \\\\n19.3.2 the object shall be returned to its original position as soon as is practicable; if play is taking place, this shall \\\\nbe as soon as the ball is dead. \\\\n19.3.3 if some part of a fence or other marker has come within the field of play, that part shall be removed from the \\\\nfield of play as soon as is practicable; if play is taking place, this shall be as soon as the ball is dead. \\\\n19.4 Ball grounded beyond the boundary \\\\n19.4.1 The ball in play is grounded beyond the boundary if it touches \\\\n33 \\\\n- the boundary or any part of an object used to mark the boundary; \\\\n- the ground beyond the boundary; \\\\n- any object that is grounded beyond the boundary. \\\\n19.4.2 The ball in play is to be regarded as being grounded beyond the boundary if \\\\n- a fielder, grounded beyond the boundary as in clause 19.5, touches the ball; \\\\n- a fielder, after catching the ball within the boundary, becomes grounded beyond the boundary while in \\\\ncontact with the ball, before completing the catch. \\\\n19.5 Fielder grounded beyond the boundary \\\\n19.5.1 A fielder is grounded beyond the boundary if some part of her person is in contact with any of the following: \\\\n- the boundary or any part of an object used to mark the boundary; \\\\n- the ground beyond the boundary; \\\\n- any object that is in contact with the ground beyond the boundary; \\\\n- another fielder who is grounded beyond the boundary. \\\\n19.5.2 A fielder who is not in contact with the ground is considered to be grounded beyond the boundary if her final \\\\ncontact with the ground, before her first contact with the ball after it has been delivered by the bowler, was \\\\nnot entirely within the boundary. \\\\n19.6 Boundary allowances \\\\n19.6.1 6 runs shall be allowed for a boundary 6; and 4 runs for a boundary 4. See also clause 19.7. \\\\n19.7 Runs scored from boundaries \\\\n19.7.1 A boundary 6 will be scored if and only if the ball has been struck by the bat and is first grounded beyond the \\\\nboundary without having been in contact with the ground within the field of play. This shall apply even if the \\\\nball has previously touched a fielder. \\\\n19.7.2 A boundary 4 will be scored when a ball that is grounded beyond the boundary \\\\n- whether struck by the bat or not, was first grounded within the boundary, or \\\\n- has not been struck by the bat. \\\\n19.7.3 When a boundary is scored, the batting side, except in the circumstances of clause 19.8, shall be awarded \\\\nwhichever is the greater of \\\\n19.7.3.1 the allowance for the boundary \\\\n19.7.3.2 the runs completed by the batters together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the \\\\ninstant the boundary is scored. \\\\n19.7.4 When the runs in clause 19.7.3.2 exceed the boundary allowance they shall replace the boundary allowance \\\\nfor the purposes of clause 18.12.2. \\\\n19.7.5 The scoring of Penalty runs by either side is not affected by the scoring of a boundary. \\\\n19.8 Overthrow or wilful act of fielder \\\\nIf the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be \\\\nany runs for penalties awarded to either side \\\\nand the allowance for the boundary \\\\n34 \\\\nand the runs completed by the batters, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the \\\\ninstant of the throw or act. \\\\nClause 18.12.2 (Batter returning to wicket she has left) shall apply as from the instant of the throw or act. \\\\n20 DEAD BALL \\\\n20.1 Ball is dead \\\\n20.1.1 The ball becomes dead when \\\\n20.1.1.1 it is finally settled in the hands of the wicket-keeper or of the bowler. \\\\n20.1.1.2 a boundary is scored. See clause 19.7 (Runs scored from boundaries). \\\\n20.1.1.3 a batter is dismissed. The ball will be deemed to be dead from the instant of the incident causing the \\\\ndismissal. \\\\n20.1.1.4 whether played or not it becomes trapped between the bat and person of a batter or between items of her \\\\nclothing or equipment. \\\\n20.1.1.5 whether played or not it lodges in the clothing or equipment of a batter or the clothing of an umpire. \\\\n20.1.1.6 there is an award of Penalty runs under either of clauses 24.4 (Player returning without permission) or 28.2 \\\\n(Fielding the ball). The ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n20.1.1.7 there is a contravention of clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side). \\\\n20.1.1.8 the match is concluded in any of the ways stated in clause 12.6 (Conclusion of match). \\\\n20.1.2 The ball shall be considered to be dead when it is clear to the bowler’s end umpire that the fielding side and \\\\nboth batters at the wicket have ceased to regard it as in play. \\\\n20.1.3 In a match where cameras are being used on or over the field of play (e.g. Spidercam), should a ball that \\\\nhas been hit by the batter make contact, while still in play, with the camera, its apparatus or its cable, either \\\\numpire shall call and signal ‘dead ball’. The ball shall not count as one of the over and no runs shall be \\\\nscored. If the delivery was called a No ball it shall count and the No ball penalty shall be applied. No other \\\\nruns (including penalty runs) apart from the No ball penalty shall be scored. \\\\n20.1.4 Should a ball thrown by a fielder make contact with a camera on or over the field of play, its apparatus or its \\\\ncable, either umpire shall call and signal dead ball. Unless this was already a No ball or Wide, the ball shall \\\\ncount as one of the over. All runs scored to that point shall count, plus the run in progress if the batters have \\\\nalready crossed. \\\\n20.1.5 Refer also to paragraph 2.7 of Appendix D. \\\\n20.2 Ball finally settled \\\\nWhether the ball is finally settled or not is a matter for the umpire alone to decide. \\\\n20.3 Call of Over or Time \\\\nNeither the call of Over (see clause 17.4), nor the call of Time (see clause 12.2) is to be made until the ball is dead, \\\\neither under clauses 20.1 or 20.4. \\\\n20.4 Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball \\\\n20.4.1 When the ball has become dead under clause 20.1, the bowler’s end umpire may call and signal Dead ball if \\\\nit is necessary to inform the players. \\\\n20.4.2 Where either umpire is required to call and signal Dead ball under 20.4.2.1 to 20.4.2.14, the ball will be \\\\nconsidered to be dead at the instant of the incident causing the ball to become dead. However, where the \\\\nPlaying Conditions specifically provide for the call to be delayed, so as not to disadvantage the non-\\\\noffending side, under clause 34.4 (Runs permitted from the ball lawfully struck more than once), clause \\\\n35 \\\\n41.2.1 (Unfair actions) and clause 42.1.2 (Unacceptable conduct), the ball will be considered to be dead at \\\\nthe point of the call. \\\\nEither umpire shall call and signal Dead ball when \\\\n20.4.2.1 intervening in a case of unfair play. \\\\n20.4.2.2 a possibly serious injury to a player or umpire occurs. \\\\n20.4.2.3 leaving his/her normal position for consultation. \\\\n20.4.2.4 one or both bails fall from the striker’s wicket before the striker has had the opportunity of playing the ball. \\\\n20.4.2.5 the striker is not ready for the delivery of the ball and, if the ball is delivered, makes no attempt to play it. \\\\nProvided the umpire is satisfied that the striker had adequate reason for not being ready, the ball shall not \\\\ncount as one of the over.  \\\\n20.4.2.6 the striker is distracted by any noise or movement or in any other way while preparing to receive, or \\\\nreceiving a delivery. This shall apply whether the source of the distraction is within the match or outside it. \\\\nNote also clause 20.4.2.6. The ball shall not count as one of the over.  \\\\n20.4.2.7 there is an instance of a deliberate attempt to distract under either of clauses 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to \\\\ndistract striker) or 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter). The ball shall not count \\\\nas one of the over.  \\\\n20.4.2.8 the bowler drops the ball accidentally before delivery.  \\\\n20.4.2.9 the bowler throws the ball towards the striker’s end before entering his/her delivery stride. \\\\n \\\\n20.4.2.10 the ball does not leave the bowler’s hand for any reason other than an attempt to run out the non-striker \\\\nunder clause 1.1 (non-striker leaving her ground early). \\\\n20.4.2.11 satisfied that the ball in play cannot be recovered. \\\\n20.4.2.12 he/she considers that either side has been disadvantaged by a person, animal or other object within the \\\\nfield of play. However, if both umpires consider the ball would have reached the boundary regardless of \\\\nthe intervention, the boundary should stand (see clause 19.2.4 - Identifying and marking the boundary). \\\\n20.4.2.13 the striker attempts to play the ball and no part of his/her person, whether grounded or raised, remains \\\\nwithin the pitch as defined in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch). \\\\n20.4.2.14 required to do so under any of the Playing Conditions not included above. \\\\n20.5 Ball ceases to be dead \\\\nThe ball ceases to be dead - that is, it comes into play - when the bowler starts her run-up or, if there is no run-up, \\\\nstarts her bowling action. \\\\n20.6 Dead ball not to be revoked \\\\nOnce the ball is dead, no revoking of any decision can bring the ball back into play for that delivery. \\\\n20.7 Dead ball; ball counting as one of over \\\\n20.7.1 When a ball which has been delivered is called dead or is to be considered dead then, other than as in \\\\nclause 20.7.2, \\\\n36 \\\\n20.7.1.1 it will not count in the over if the striker has not had an opportunity to play it. \\\\n20.7.1.2 unless No ball or Wide ball has been called, it will be a valid ball if the striker has had an opportunity to \\\\nplay it, except in the circumstances of clauses 20.4.2.5 and 24.4 (Player returning without permission), \\\\n28.2 (Fielding the ball), 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to distract striker) and 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, \\\\ndeception or obstruction of batter). \\\\n20.7.2 In clause 20.4.2.4, the ball will not count in the over only if both conditions of not attempting to play the ball \\\\nand having an adequate reason for not being ready are met. Otherwise the delivery will be a valid ball. \\\\n21 NO BALL \\\\n21.1 Mode of delivery \\\\n21.1.1 The umpire shall ascertain whether the bowler intends to bowl right handed or left handed, over or round the \\\\nwicket, and shall so inform the striker. \\\\nIt is unfair if the bowler fails to notify the umpire of a change in her mode of delivery. In this case the umpire \\\\nshall call and signal No ball. \\\\n21.1.2 Underarm bowling shall not be permitted. \\\\n21.2 Fair delivery - the arm \\\\nFor a delivery to be fair in respect of the arm the ball must not be delivered with an Illegal Bowling Action. \\\\nAn Illegal Bowling Action is defined as a bowling action where a bowler’s Elbow Extension exceeds 15 degrees, \\\\nmeasured from the point at which the bowling arm reaches the horizontal until the point at which the ball is released \\\\n(any Elbow Hyperextension shall be discounted for the purposes of determining an Illegal Bowling Action). \\\\nShould either umpire or the ICC Match Referee suspect that a bowler has used an Illegal Bowling Action, they shall \\\\ncomplete the ICC Bowling Action Report Form at the conclusion of the match, as set out in the Illegal Bowling \\\\nRegulations. \\\\n21.3 Ball thrown or delivered underarm - action by umpires \\\\n21.3.1 If, in the opinion of either umpire, the ball has been thrown (where such mode of delivery does not \\\\ncorrespond to the bowler’s normal bowling action) or delivered underarm, he/she shall call and signal No ball \\\\nand, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- warn the bowler, indicating that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall apply to that bowler \\\\nthroughout the innings. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the batters at the wicket of what has occurred. \\\\n21.3.2 If either umpire considers that, in that innings, a further delivery by the same bowler is thrown (where such \\\\nmode of delivery does not correspond to the bowler’s normal bowling action) or delivered underarm, he/she \\\\nshall call and signal No ball and when the ball is dead inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling. The over shall, if \\\\napplicable, be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled the previous over or part thereof \\\\nnor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. The bowler thus suspended shall not bowl again in that \\\\ninnings. \\\\n- inform the batters at the wicket and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the reason for \\\\nthis action. \\\\n37 \\\\n21.3.3 The umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the ICC Match \\\\nReferee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n21.4 Bowler throwing towards striker’s end before delivery \\\\nIf the bowler throws the ball towards the striker’s end before entering the delivery stride, it is not a No ball and the \\\\nprocedure stated in 21.3 shall not apply. However, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball under Clause 20.4.2.9.  \\\\n21.5 Fair delivery - the feet \\\\nFor a delivery to be fair in respect of the feet, in the delivery stride \\\\n21.5.1 the bowler’s back foot must land within and not touching the return crease appertaining to her stated mode \\\\nof delivery. \\\\n21.5.2 the bowler’s front foot must land with some part of the foot, whether grounded or raised \\\\n- on the same side of the imaginary line joining the two middle stumps as the return crease described in \\\\nclause 21.5.1, and \\\\n- behind the popping crease. \\\\nIf the bowler’s end umpire is satisfied that any of these three conditions have not been met, he/she shall call and \\\\nsignal No ball. See clause 41.8 (Bowling of deliberate front foot No ball). \\\\nFor televised matches, the third umpire shall review television replays of the bowler’s feet landing and, if he/she is \\\\nsatisfied that not all the requirements have been met, advise the bowler’s end umpire who shall in turn immediately \\\\ncall and signal No ball. See clause 41.8 (Bowling of deliberate front foot No ball). \\\\n21.6 Bowler breaking wicket in delivering ball \\\\nEither umpire shall call and signal No ball if, other than in an attempt to run out the non-striker under clause 38.3 \\\\n(Non-striker leaving his/her ground early), the bowler breaks the wicket at any time after the ball comes into play and \\\\nbefore completion of the stride after the delivery stride. This shall include any clothing or other object that falls from \\\\nher person and breaks the wicket. \\\\n21.7 Ball bouncing more than once, rolling along the ground or pitching off the pitch \\\\nThe umpire shall call and signal No ball if a ball which he/she considers to have been delivered, without having \\\\npreviously touched bat or person of the striker, \\\\n- bounces more than once or rolls along the ground before it reaches the popping crease. \\\\n- or pitches wholly or partially off the pitch as defined in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch) before it reaches the line of the \\\\nstriker’s wicket. \\\\n21.8 Ball causing the striker to leave the pitch or ball coming to rest in front of striker’s \\\\nwicket \\\\nIf a ball delivered by the bowler comes to rest in front of the line of the striker’s wicket or is so far from the pitch that \\\\nthe striker would need to leave the pitch to attempt to play the ball (see clause 25.6 - Striker’s right to play the ball), \\\\nwithout having previously touched the bat or person of the striker, the umpire shall call and signal No ball and \\\\nimmediately call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n21.9 Fielder intercepting a delivery \\\\nIf, except in the circumstances of clause 27.3 (Position of wicket-keeper) a ball delivered by the bowler, makes \\\\ncontact with any part of a fielder’s person before it either makes contact with the striker’s bat or person, or it passes \\\\nthe striker’s wicket, the umpire shall call and signal No ball and immediately call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n21.10 Ball bouncing over head height of striker \\\\nSee clauses 22.1.1.2, 41.6.4 and 41.6.5. \\\\n38 \\\\n21.11 Call of No ball for infringement of other Playing Conditions \\\\nIn addition to the instances above, No ball is to be called and signalled as required by the following clauses: \\\\nClause 27.3 - Position of wicket-keeper \\\\nClause 28.4 - Limitation of on side fielders \\\\nClause 28.5 - Fielders not to encroach on pitch \\\\nClause 41.6 - Bowling of dangerous and unfair short pitched deliveries \\\\nClause 41.7 - Bowling of dangerous and unfair non-pitching deliveries \\\\nClause 41.8 - Bowling of deliberate front foot No ball. \\\\n21.12 Revoking a call of No ball \\\\nAn umpire shall revoke the call of No ball if Dead ball is called under any of Laws 20.4.2.4, 20.4.2.5, 20.4.2.6, \\\\n20.4.2.8 or 20.4.2.10 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball). \\\\n21.13 No ball to over-ride Wide \\\\nA call of No ball shall over-ride the call of Wide ball at any time. See clauses 22.1 (Judging a Wide) and 22.2 (Call \\\\nand signal of Wide ball). \\\\n21.14 Ball not dead \\\\nThe ball does not become dead on the call of No ball. \\\\n21.15 Penalty for a No ball \\\\nA penalty of one run shall be awarded instantly on the call of No ball. Unless the call is revoked, the penalty shall \\\\nstand even if a batter is dismissed. It shall be in addition to any other runs scored, any boundary allowance and any \\\\nother runs awarded for penalties. \\\\n21.16 Runs resulting from a No ball - how scored \\\\nThe one run penalty shall be scored as a No ball extra and shall be debited against the bowler. If other Penalty runs \\\\nhave been awarded to either side these shall be scored as stated in clause 41.17 (Penalty runs). Any runs completed \\\\nby the batters or any boundary allowance shall be credited to the striker if the ball has been struck by the bat; \\\\notherwise they shall also be scored as Byes or Leg byes as appropriate. \\\\n21.17 No ball not to count \\\\nA No ball shall not count as one of the over. See clause 17.3 (Validity of balls). \\\\n21.18 Out from a No ball \\\\nWhen No ball has been called, neither batter shall be out under any of the Playing Conditions except clause 34 (Hit \\\\nthe ball twice), clause 37 (Obstructing the field) or clause 38 (Run out). \\\\n22 WIDE BALL \\\\n22.1 Judging a Wide \\\\n22.1.1 If the bowler bowls a ball, not being a No ball, the umpire shall adjudge it a Wide if, according to the \\\\ndefinition in clause 22.1.2 \\\\n39 \\\\n22.1.1.1 the ball passes wide of where the striker is standing and which also would have passed wide of the striker \\\\nstanding in a normal guard position. \\\\n22.1.1.2 the ball passes above the head height of the striker standing upright at the popping crease. \\\\n22.1.2 The ball will be considered as passing wide of the striker unless it is sufficiently within reach for her to be \\\\nable to hit it with the bat by means of a normal cricket stroke. \\\\n22.1.3 For bowlers attempting to utilise the rough outside a batter’s leg stump, not necessarily as a negative tactic, \\\\nthe strict limited over Wide interpretation shall be applied. \\\\n22.1.4 For bowlers whom umpires consider to be bowling down the leg side as a negative tactic, the strict limited \\\\nover Wide interpretation shall be applied. \\\\n22.2 Call and signal of Wide ball \\\\nIf the umpire adjudges a delivery to be a Wide he/she shall call and signal Wide ball as soon as the ball passes the \\\\nstriker’s wicket. It shall, however, be considered to have been a Wide from the instant that the bowler entered her \\\\ndelivery stride, even though it cannot be called Wide until it passes the striker’s wicket. \\\\n22.3 Revoking a call of Wide ball \\\\n22.3.1 The umpire shall revoke the call of Wide ball if there is any contact between the ball and the striker’s bat or \\\\nperson before the ball comes into contact with any fielder. \\\\n22.3.2 The umpire shall revoke the call of Wide ball if a delivery is called a No ball. See clause 21.13 (No ball to \\\\nover-ride Wide). \\\\n22.4 Delivery not a Wide \\\\n22.4.1 The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide, if the striker, by moving, either causes the ball to \\\\npass wide of her, as defined in clause 22.1.2 or brings the ball sufficiently within reach to be able to hit it by \\\\nmeans of a normal cricket stroke. \\\\n22.4.2 The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide if the ball touches the striker’s bat or person, but \\\\nonly as the ball passes the striker. \\\\n22.5 Ball not dead \\\\nThe ball does not become dead on the call of Wide ball. \\\\n22.6 Penalty for a Wide \\\\nA penalty of one run shall be awarded instantly on the call of Wide ball. Unless the call is revoked, see clause 22.3, \\\\nthis penalty shall stand even if a batter is dismissed, and shall be in addition to any other runs scored, any boundary \\\\nallowance and any other runs awarded for penalties. \\\\n22.7 Runs resulting from a Wide - how scored \\\\nAll runs completed by the batters or a boundary allowance, together with the penalty for the Wide, shall be scored as \\\\nWide balls. Apart from any award of 5 Penalty runs, all runs resulting from a Wide shall be debited against the bowler. \\\\n22.8 Wide not to count \\\\nA Wide shall not count as one of the over. See clause 17.3 (Validity of balls). \\\\n22.9 Out from a Wide \\\\nWhen Wide ball has been called, neither batter shall be out under any of the Playing Conditions except clause 35 (Hit \\\\nwicket), clause 37 (Obstructing the field), clause 38 (Run out) or clause 39 (Stumped). \\\\n40 \\\\n23 BYE AND LEG BYE \\\\n23.1 Byes \\\\nIf the ball, delivered by the bowler, not being a Wide, passes the striker without touching her bat or person, any runs \\\\ncompleted by the batters from that delivery, or a boundary allowance, shall be credited as Byes to the batting side. \\\\nAdditionally, if the delivery is a No ball, the one run penalty for such a delivery shall be incurred. \\\\n23.2 Leg byes \\\\n23.2.1 If a ball delivered by the bowler first strikes the person of the striker, runs shall be scored only if the umpire \\\\nis satisfied that the striker has \\\\neither attempted to play the ball with the bat; or \\\\ntried to avoid being hit by the ball. \\\\n23.2.2 If the umpire is satisfied that either of these conditions has been met runs shall be scored as follows. \\\\n23.2.2.1 If there is \\\\neither no subsequent contact with the striker’s bat or person, or \\\\nonly inadvertent contact with the striker’s bat or person, \\\\nany runs completed by the batters or a boundary allowance shall be credited to the striker in the \\\\ncase of subsequent contact with her bat but otherwise to the batting side as in clause 23.2.3. \\\\n23.2.2.2 If the striker wilfully makes a lawful second strike, clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once) and \\\\nclause 34.4 (Runs permitted from ball lawfully struck more than once) shall apply. \\\\n23.2.3 The runs in clause 23.2.2.1, unless credited to the striker, shall be scored as Leg byes. \\\\nAdditionally, if the delivery is a No ball, the one run penalty for the No ball shall be incurred. \\\\n23.3 Leg byes not to be awarded \\\\nIf in the circumstance of clause 23.2.1 the umpire considers that neither of the conditions therein has been met, then \\\\nLeg byes shall not be awarded. \\\\nIf the ball does not become dead for any other reason, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball as soon as the ball \\\\nreaches the boundary or at the completion of the first run. \\\\nThe umpire shall then: \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side; \\\\n- return any not out batter to her original end; \\\\n- signal No ball to the scorers if applicable; \\\\n- award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging \\\\nto the fielding side). \\\\n24 FIELDER’S ABSENCE; SUBSTITUTES \\\\n24.1 Substitute fielders \\\\n24.1.1 The umpires shall allow a substitute fielder \\\\n24.1.1.1 if they are satisfied that a fielder has been injured or become ill and that this occurred during the match, or \\\\n24.1.1.2 for any other wholly acceptable reason. \\\\nIn all other circumstances, a substitute is not allowed. \\\\n41 \\\\n24.1.2 A substitute shall not bowl or act as captain but may act as wicket-keeper only with the consent of the \\\\numpires. Note, however, clause 42.4.1. \\\\n24.1.3 A nominated player may bowl or field even though a substitute has previously acted for her, subject to \\\\nclauses 24.2 and 24.3. \\\\n24.1.4 Squad members of the fielding or batting team who are not playing in the match and who are not acting as \\\\nsubstitute fielders shall be required to wear a team training bib whilst on the playing area (including the area \\\\nbetween the boundary and the perimeter fencing). \\\\n24.2 Fielder absent or leaving the field of play \\\\n24.2.1 A player going briefly outside the boundary while carrying out any duties as a fielder is not absent from the \\\\nfield of play nor, for the purposes of this clause, is she to be regarded as having left the field of play. \\\\n24.2.2 If a fielder fails to take the field at the start of play or at any later time, or leaves the field during play, \\\\n24.2.2.1 an umpire shall be informed of the reason for this absence. \\\\n24.2.2.2 she shall not thereafter come on to the field of play during a session of play without the consent of the \\\\numpire. See clause 24.4. The umpire shall give such consent as soon as it is practicable. \\\\n24.2.3 If a player is absent from the field for longer than 8 minutes, the following restrictions shall apply to their \\\\nfuture participation in the match: \\\\n24.2.3.1 The player shall not be permitted to bowl in the match until she has either been able to field, or her team \\\\nhas subsequently been batting, for the total length of playing time for which the player was absent \\\\n(hereafter referred to as Penalty time). A player’s unexpired Penalty time shall be limited to a maximum of \\\\n110 minutes. If any unexpired Penalty time remains at the end of an innings, it is carried forward to the \\\\nnext and subsequent innings of the match. \\\\n24.2.3.2 The player shall not be permitted to bat in the match until her team’s batting innings has been in progress \\\\nfor the length of playing time that is equal to the unexpired Penalty time carried forward from the previous \\\\ninnings. However, once her side has lost five wickets in its batting innings, she may bat immediately. If any \\\\nunexpired penalty time remains at the end of that batting innings, it is carried forward to the next and \\\\nsubsequent innings of the match. \\\\n24.2.4 If the player leaves the field before having served all of her Penalty time, the balance is carried forward as \\\\nunserved Penalty time. \\\\n24.2.5 On any occasion of absence, the amount of playing time for which the player is off the field shall be added to \\\\nany Penalty time that remains unserved, subject to a maximum cumulative Penalty time of 110 minutes, and \\\\nthat player shall not bowl until all of her Penalty time has been served. \\\\n24.2.6 For the purposes of clauses 24.2.3.1 and 24.2.3.2, playing time shall comprise the time play is in progress \\\\nexcluding lunch and tea intervals, intervals between innings and official drinks intervals. For clarity, a \\\\nplayer’s Penalty time will continue to expire after she is dismissed, for the remainder of her team’s batting \\\\ninnings. \\\\n24.2.7 If there is an unscheduled break in play, the stoppage time shall count as Penalty time served, provided that, \\\\n24.2.7.1 the fielder who was on the field of play at the start of the break either takes the field on the resumption of \\\\nplay, or her side is now batting. \\\\n24.2.7.2 the fielder who was already off the field at the start of the break notifies an umpire in person as soon as \\\\nshe is able to participate, and either takes the field on the resumption of play, or her side is now batting. \\\\nStoppage time before an umpire has been so notified shall not count towards unserved Penalty time. \\\\n24.2.8 Any unserved Penalty time shall be carried forward into the next and subsequent days and innings of the \\\\nmatch, as applicable. \\\\n24.3 Penalty time not incurred \\\\nA nominated player’s absence will not incur Penalty time if, \\\\n42 \\\\n24.3.1 she has suffered an external blow during the match and, as a result, has justifiably left the field or is unable \\\\nto take the field. \\\\n24.3.2 in the opinion of the umpires, the player has been absent or has left the field for other wholly acceptable \\\\nreasons, which shall not include illness or internal injury. \\\\n24.3.3 the player is absent from the field for a period of 8 minutes or less. \\\\n24.4 Player returning without permission \\\\nIf a player comes on to the field of play in contravention of clause 24.2.2 and comes into contact with the ball while it \\\\nis in play, the ball shall immediately become dead. \\\\n- The umpires shall signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers, if applicable. \\\\n- The umpire shall award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\n- Runs completed by the batters shall be scored together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the \\\\ninstant of the offence. \\\\n- The ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n- The umpire shall inform the other umpire, the captain of the fielding side, the batters and, as soon as practicable, \\\\nthe captain of the batting side of the reason for this action. \\\\n25 BATTER’S INNINGS \\\\n25.1 Eligibility to act as a batter \\\\nOnly a nominated player may bat and, subject to clause 25.3, may do so even though a substitute fielder has \\\\npreviously acted for her. \\\\n25.2 Commencement of a batter’s innings \\\\nThe innings of the first two batters, and that of any new batter on the resumption of play after a call of Time, shall \\\\ncommence at the call of Play. At any other time, a batter’s innings shall be considered to have commenced when that \\\\nbatter first steps onto the field of play. \\\\n25.3 Restriction on batter commencing an innings \\\\n25.3.1 If a member of the batting side has unserved Penalty time (see clause 24.2.7) that player shall not be \\\\npermitted to bat until that Penalty time has been served. However, even if the unserved Penalty time has not \\\\nexpired, that player may bat after her side has lost 5 wickets. \\\\n25.3.2 A member of the batting side’s Penalty time is served during Playing time. In the event of an unscheduled \\\\nstoppage, the stoppage time after the batter notifies an umpire in person that she is able to participate shall \\\\ncount as Penalty time served. \\\\n25.3.3 If any unserved Penalty time remains at the end of a team’s innings, it shall be carried forward to the next \\\\nand subsequent innings of the match if appropriate. \\\\n25.4 Batter retiring \\\\n25.4.1 A batter may retire at any time during her innings when the ball is dead. The umpires, before allowing play to \\\\nproceed, shall be informed of the reason for a batter retiring. \\\\n25.4.2 If a batter retires because of illness, injury or any other unavoidable cause, that batter is entitled to resume \\\\nher innings. If for any reason this does not happen, that batter is to be recorded as ‘Retired - not out’. \\\\n25.4.3 If a batter retires for any reason other than as in clause 25.4.2, the innings of that batter may be resumed \\\\nonly with the consent of the opposing captain. If for any reason her innings is not resumed, that batter is to \\\\nbe recorded as ‘Retired - out’. \\\\n43 \\\\n25.4.4 If after retiring a batter resumes her innings, subject to the requirements of clauses 25.4.2 and 25.4.3, it shall \\\\nbe only at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of another batter. \\\\n25.5 Runners \\\\nRunners shall not be permitted.  \\\\n25.6 Striker’s right to play the ball \\\\nThe striker has a right to play the ball, or to make a legitimate second strike, after it has been delivered, without \\\\ninterference from the wicket-keeper or any other fielder (see clause 27.5 - Restrictions on actions of wicket-keeper \\\\nand clause 27.6 - Interference with wicket-keeper by striker). \\\\nHowever, the striker may only attempt to play the ball if some of his/her bat or person, whether grounded or raised, \\\\nremains within the pitch, as defined in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch). Should no part of the striker’s bat or person \\\\nremain within the pitch, whilst the striker is playing the ball, either umpire shall immediately call and signal \\\\nDead ball.  \\\\n26 PRACTICE ON THE FIELD \\\\n26.1 Practice on the pitch or the rest of the square \\\\n26.1.1 There shall not be any practice on the pitch at any time on any day of the match. \\\\n26.1.2 There shall not be any practice on the rest of the square at any time on any day of the match, except with \\\\nthe approval of the umpires. \\\\n26.1.2.1 If approved by the umpires, the use of the square for practice on any day of any match will be restricted to \\\\nany netted practice area or bowling strips specifically prepared on the edge of the square for that purpose. \\\\n26.1.2.2 Bowling practice on the bowling strips referred to above shall also be permitted during the interval (and \\\\nchange of innings if not the interval) unless the umpires consider that, in the prevailing conditions of \\\\nground and weather, it will be detrimental to the surface of the square. \\\\n26.2 Practice on the outfield \\\\n26.2.1 On any day of the match, all forms of practice are permitted on the outfield \\\\n- before the start of play; \\\\n- after the close of play; and \\\\n- during the lunch and tea intervals or between innings, \\\\nproviding the umpires are satisfied that such practice will not cause significant deterioration in the condition \\\\nof the outfield. \\\\n26.2.2 Between the call of Play and the call of Time, practice shall be permitted on the outfield, providing that all of \\\\nthe following conditions are met: \\\\n- only the fielders (as defined in paragraph 7 of Appendix A) participate in such practice. \\\\n- no ball other than the match ball is used for this practice. \\\\n- no bowling practice takes place in the area between the square and the boundary in a direction parallel to \\\\nthe match pitch. \\\\n- the umpires are satisfied that it will not contravene either of clauses 41.3 (The match ball changing its \\\\ncondition) or 41.9 (Time wasting by the fielding side). \\\\nBowling a ball, using a short run up to a player in the outfield is not to be regarded as bowling practice but \\\\nshall be subject to the other conditions in this clause. \\\\n44 \\\\n26.3 Trial run-up \\\\nA bowler is permitted to have a trial run-up provided the umpire is satisfied that it will not contravene either of clauses \\\\n41.9 (Time wasting by the fielding side) or 41.12 (Fielder damaging the pitch). \\\\n26.4 Penalties for contravention \\\\nAll forms of practice are subject to the provisions of clauses 41.13 (The match ball - changing its condition), 41.9 \\\\n(Time wasting by the fielding side) and 41.12 (Fielder damaging the pitch). \\\\n26.4.1 If there is a contravention of any of the provisions of clause 26.1 or 26.2, the umpire shall \\\\n- warn the player that the practice is not permitted; \\\\n- inform the other umpire and, as soon as practicable, both captains of the reason for this action. \\\\n26.4.1.1 If the contravention is by a batter at the wicket, the umpire shall inform the other batter and each incoming \\\\nbatter that the warning has been issued. The warning shall apply to the team of that player throughout the \\\\nmatch. \\\\n26.4.2 If during the match there is any further contravention by any player of that team, the umpire shall \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side; \\\\n- inform the other umpire, the scorers and, as soon as practicable, both captains, and, if the contravention is \\\\nduring play, the batters at the wicket. \\\\n27 THE WICKET-KEEPER \\\\n27.1 Protective equipment \\\\nThe wicket-keeper is the only fielder permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards. If these are worn, they are to \\\\nbe regarded as part of her person for the purposes of clause 28.2 (Fielding the ball). If by the wicket-keeper’s actions \\\\nand positioning when the ball comes into play it is apparent to the umpires that she will not be able to carry out the \\\\nnormal duties of a wicket-keeper, she shall forfeit this right and also the right to be recognised as a wicket-keeper for \\\\nthe purposes of clauses 33.2 (A fair catch), 39 (Stumped), 28.1 (Protective equipment), 28.4 (Limitation of on-side \\\\nfielders) and 28.5 (Fielders not to encroach on pitch). \\\\n27.2 Gloves \\\\n27.2.1 If, as permitted under clause 27.1, the wicket-keeper wears gloves, they shall have no webbing between the \\\\nfingers except joining index finger and thumb, where webbing may be inserted as a means of support. \\\\n27.2.2 If used, the webbing shall be a single piece of non-stretch material which, although it may have facing \\\\nmaterial attached, shall have no reinforcements or tucks. \\\\n27.2.3 The top edge of the webbing shall not protrude beyond the straight line joining the top of the index finger to \\\\nthe top of the thumb and shall be taut when a hand wearing the glove has the thumb fully extended. See \\\\nparagraph 3 of Appendix B. \\\\n27.3 Position of wicket-keeper \\\\n27.3.1 The wicket-keeper shall remain wholly behind the wicket at the striker’s end from the moment the ball comes \\\\ninto play until a ball delivered by the bowler: \\\\ntouches the bat or person of the striker; or \\\\npasses the wicket at the striker’s end; or \\\\nthe striker attempts a run. \\\\n27.3.2 In the event of the wicket-keeper contravening this clause, the striker’s end umpire shall call and signal No \\\\nball as soon as applicable after the delivery of the ball. \\\\n45 \\\\n27.4 Movement by wicket-keeper \\\\n27.4.1 After the ball comes into play and before it reaches the striker, it is unfair if the wicket-keeper significantly \\\\nalters her position in relation to the striker’s wicket, except for the following: \\\\n27.4.1.1 movement of a few paces forward for a slower delivery, unless in so doing it brings her within reach of the \\\\nwicket. \\\\n27.4.1.2 lateral movement in response to the direction in which the ball has been delivered. \\\\n27.4.1.3 movement in response to the stroke that the striker is playing or that her actions suggest she intends to \\\\nplay. However the provisions of clause 27.3 shall apply. \\\\n27.4.2 In the event of unfair movement by the wicket-keeper, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball and \\\\ninform the other umpire of the reason for doing so. The bowler’s end umpire shall then: \\\\n27.4.2.1 award the one-run penalty for Wide or No ball, if applicable  \\\\n27.4.2.2 award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side \\\\n27.4.2.3 inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\n27.4.2.4 inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the ICC \\\\nMatch Referee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the wicket-keeper \\\\nconcerned. \\\\n27.5 Restriction on actions of wicket-keeper \\\\nIf, in the opinion of either umpire, the wicket-keeper interferes with the striker’s right to play the ball and to guard her \\\\nwicket, clause 20.4.2.5 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball) shall apply. \\\\nIf, however, either umpire considers that the interference by the wicket-keeper was wilful, then clause 41.4 \\\\n(Deliberate attempt to distract striker) shall also apply. \\\\n27.6 Interference with wicket-keeper by striker \\\\nIf, in playing at the ball or in the legitimate defence of her wicket, the striker interferes with the wicket-keeper, she \\\\nshall not be out except as provided for in clause 37.3 (Obstructing a ball from being caught). \\\\n28 THE FIELDER \\\\n28.1 Protective equipment \\\\nNo fielder other than the wicket-keeper shall be permitted to wear gloves or external leg guards. In addition, \\\\nprotection for the hand or fingers may be worn only with the consent of the umpires. \\\\n28.2 Fielding the ball \\\\n28.2.1 A fielder may field the ball with any part of her person (see paragraph 12 of Appendix A), except as in clause \\\\n28.2.1.2. However, she will be deemed to have fielded the ball illegally if, while the ball is in play she wilfully: \\\\n28.2.1.1 uses anything other than part of her person to field the ball. \\\\n28.2.1.2 extends her clothing with her hands and uses this to field the ball. \\\\n28.2.1.3 discards a piece of clothing, equipment or any other object which subsequently makes contact with the \\\\nball. \\\\n28.2.2 It is not illegal fielding if the ball in play makes contact with a piece of clothing, equipment or any other object \\\\nwhich has accidentally fallen from the fielder’s person, or been dropped by an umpire. \\\\n28.2.3 If a fielder illegally fields the ball, the ball shall immediately become dead and \\\\n- the penalty for a No ball or a Wide shall stand. \\\\n46 \\\\n- any runs completed by the batters shall be credited to the batting side, together with the run in progress if \\\\nthe batters had already crossed at the instant of the offence. \\\\n- the ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\nIn addition the umpire shall: \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\n- inform the other umpire and the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. \\\\n28.3 Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side \\\\n28.3.1 Protective helmets, when not in use by fielders, may not be placed on the ground, above the surface except \\\\nbehind the wicket-keeper and in line with both sets of stumps. \\\\n28.3.2 If the ball while in play strikes the protective helmet, placed as described in clause 28.3.1, the ball shall \\\\nimmediately become Dead and, unless 28.3.3. applies: \\\\nthe umpire shall signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers, if applicable \\\\n28.3.2.1 the ball shall become dead \\\\n   the umpire award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side; \\\\n28.3.2.2 any runs completed by the batters before the ball strikes the protective helmet shall be scored, together \\\\nwith the run in progress if the batters had already crossed at the instant of the ball striking the protective \\\\nhelmet. \\\\n28.3.3 If the ball while in play strikes the protective helmet, placed as described in clause 28.3.1, and the \\\\ncircumstances of clause 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded) or clause 34 (Hit the ball twice) apply, the \\\\numpire shall: \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\\\n- return any not out batter to her original end \\\\n- signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers if applicable \\\\n- award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3.2. \\\\n28.4 Limitation of on side fielders \\\\nAt the instant of the bowler’s delivery there shall not be more than two fielders, other than the wicket-keeper, behind \\\\nthe popping crease on the on side. A fielder will be considered to be behind the popping crease unless the whole of \\\\nher person whether grounded or in the air is in front of this line. \\\\nIn the event of infringement of this clause by any fielder, the striker’s end umpire shall call and signal No ball. \\\\n28.5 Fielders not to encroach on pitch \\\\nWhile the ball is in play and until the ball has made contact with the striker’s bat or person, or has passed the striker’s \\\\nbat, no fielder, other than the bowler, may have any part of her person grounded on or extended over the pitch. \\\\nIn the event of infringement of this clause by any fielder other than the wicket-keeper, the bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\ncall and signal No ball as soon as possible after delivery of the ball. Note, however, clause 27.3 (Position of wicket-\\\\nkeeper). \\\\n28.6 Movement by any fielder other than the wicket-keeper \\\\n28.6.1 Any movement by any fielder, excluding the wicket-keeper, after the ball comes into play and before the ball \\\\nreaches the striker, is unfair except for the following: \\\\n47 \\\\n28.6.1.1 minor adjustments to stance or position in relation to the striker’s wicket. \\\\n28.6.1.2 movement by any fielder, other than a close fielder, towards the striker or the striker’s wicket that does not \\\\nsignificantly alter the position of the fielder. \\\\n28.6.1.3 movement by any fielder in response to the stroke that the striker is playing or that her actions suggest she \\\\nintends to play. \\\\n28.6.2 In all circumstances clause 28.4 (Limitation of on side fielders) shall apply. \\\\n28.6.3 In the event of such unfair movement, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball and inform the other \\\\numpire of the reason for doing so. The bowler’s end umpire shall then: \\\\n28.6.3.1 award the one-run penalty for Wide or No ball, if applicable  \\\\n28.6.3.2 award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side \\\\n28.6.3.3 inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\n28.6.3.4 inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has \\\\noccurred. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the ICC \\\\nMatch Referee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the fielder \\\\nconcerned. \\\\n28.6.4 Note also the provisions of clause 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to distract striker). See also clause 27.4 \\\\n(Movement by wicket-keeper). \\\\n29 THE WICKET IS BROKEN \\\\n29.1 Wicket fairly broken \\\\nThe wicket is broken when at least one bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps, or one or more \\\\nstumps is removed from the ground. \\\\n29.2 Breaking the wicket fairly \\\\n29.2.1 The wicket is broken fairly if a bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps or a stump is struck out of \\\\nthe ground. \\\\n29.2.1.1 by the ball, \\\\n29.2.1.2 by the striker’s bat if held or by any part of the bat that she is holding, \\\\n29.2.1.3 for the purpose of this clause only, by the striker\\'s bat not in hand, or by any part of the bat which has \\\\nbecome detached, \\\\n29.2.1.4 by the striker’s person or by any part of her clothing or equipment becoming detached from her person, \\\\n29.2.1.5 by a fielder with her hand or arm, providing that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the \\\\nhand of the arm so used. \\\\n29.2.1.6 The wicket is also fairly broken if a fielder strikes or pulls a stump out of the ground as in clause 29.1.1.5. \\\\n29.2.2 The disturbance of a bail, whether temporary or not, shall not constitute its complete removal from the top of \\\\nthe stumps, but if a bail in falling lodges between two of the stumps this shall be regarded as complete \\\\nremoval. \\\\n29.3 One bail off \\\\nIf one bail is off, it shall be sufficient for the purpose of breaking the wicket to remove the remaining bail or to strike or \\\\npull any of the three stumps out of the ground, in any of the ways stated in clause 29.1. \\\\n48 \\\\n29.4 Remaking wicket \\\\nIf a wicket is broken or fairly broken while the ball is in play, it shall not be remade by an umpire until the ball is dead. \\\\nSee clause 20 (Dead ball). Any fielder may, however, while the ball is in play, \\\\n- replace a bail or bails on top of the stumps. \\\\n- put back one or more stumps into the ground where the wicket originally stood. \\\\n29.5 Dispensing with bails \\\\nIf the umpires have agreed to dispense with bails in accordance with clause 8.4 (Dispensing with bails), it is for the \\\\numpire concerned to decide whether or not the wicket has been broken. \\\\n29.5.1 After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been broken fairly if the umpire concerned is satisfied \\\\nthat the wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker’s bat, person or items of her clothing or equipment \\\\nas described in clauses 29.2.1.2, 29.2.1.3or29.2.1.4, or by a fielder in the manner described in clause \\\\n29.2.5.1. \\\\nIf the wicket has already been broken or fairly broken, clause 29.2.1.5 shall apply to any stump or stumps \\\\nstill in the ground. Any fielder may replace a stump or stumps, in accordance with clause 29.4, in order to \\\\nhave an opportunity of putting the wicket down. \\\\n30 BATTER OUT OF HER GROUND \\\\n30.1 When out of her ground \\\\n30.1.1 A batter shall be considered to be out of her ground unless some part of her person or bat is grounded \\\\nbehind the popping crease at that end. \\\\n30.1.2 However, a batter shall not be considered to be out of her ground if, in running or diving towards her ground \\\\nand beyond, and having grounded some part of her person or bat beyond the popping crease, there is \\\\nsubsequent loss of contact: between the ground and any part of her person or bat, or between the bat and \\\\nperson. \\\\n30.2 Which is a batter’s ground \\\\n30.2.1 If only one batter is within a ground, it is her ground and will remain so even if she is later joined there by the \\\\nother batter. \\\\n30.2.2 If both batters are in the same ground and one of them subsequently leaves it, the ground belongs to the \\\\nbatter who remains in it. \\\\n30.2.3 If there is no batter in either ground, then each ground belongs to whichever batter is nearer to it, or, if the \\\\nbatters are level, to whichever batter was nearer to it immediately prior to their drawing level. \\\\n30.2.4 If a ground belongs to one batter then the other ground belongs to the other batter, irrespective of her \\\\nposition. \\\\n30.3 Position of non-striker \\\\nThe non-striker, when standing at the bowler’s end, should be positioned on the opposite side of the wicket to that \\\\nfrom which the ball is being delivered, unless a request to do otherwise is granted by the umpire. \\\\n31 APPEALS \\\\n31.1 Umpire not to give batter out without an appeal \\\\nNeither umpire shall give a batter out, even though she may be out under these Playing Conditions, unless appealed \\\\nto by a fielder. This shall not debar a batter who is out under these Playing Conditions from leaving the wicket without \\\\nan appeal having been made. Note, however, the provisions of clause 31.7. \\\\n49 \\\\n31.2 Batter dismissed \\\\nA batter is dismissed if she is \\\\neither given out by an umpire, on appeal \\\\nor out under these Playing Conditions and leaves the wicket as in clause 31.1. \\\\n31.3 Timing of appeals \\\\nFor an appeal to be valid, it must be made before the bowler begins her run-up or, if there is no run-up, her bowling \\\\naction to deliver the next ball, and before Time has been called. \\\\nThe call of Over does not invalidate an appeal made prior to the start of the following over, provided Time has not \\\\nbeen called. See clauses 12.2 (Call of Time) and 17.2 (Start of an over). \\\\n31.4 Appeal “How’s That?” \\\\nAn appeal “How’s That?” covers all ways of being out. \\\\nRefer also to Appendix D – DRS and Third Umpire Protocol. \\\\n31.5 Answering appeals \\\\nThe striker’s end umpire shall answer all appeals arising out of any of clauses 35 (Hit wicket), 39 (Stumped) or 38 \\\\n(Run out) when this occurs at the wicket-keeper’s end. The bowler’s end umpire shall answer all other appeals. \\\\nWhen an appeal is made, each umpire shall answer on any matter that falls within her jurisdiction. \\\\nWhen a batter has been given Not out, either umpire may answer an appeal, made in accordance with clause 31.3, if \\\\nit is on a further matter and is within her jurisdiction. \\\\n31.6 Consultation by umpires \\\\nEach umpire shall answer appeals on matters within her own jurisdiction. If an umpire is doubtful about any point that \\\\nthe other umpire may have been in a better position to see, he/she shall consult the latter on this point of fact and \\\\nshall then give the decision. If, after consultation, there is still doubt remaining, the decision shall be Not out. \\\\n31.7 Batter leaving the wicket under a misapprehension \\\\nAn umpire shall intervene if satisfied that a batter, not having been given out, has left the wicket under a \\\\nmisapprehension of being out. The umpire intervening shall call and signal Dead ball to prevent any further action by \\\\nthe fielding side and shall recall the batter. \\\\nA batter may be recalled at any time up to the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery, unless it is \\\\nthe final wicket of the innings, in which case it should be up to the instant when the umpires leave the field. \\\\n31.8 Withdrawal of an appeal \\\\nThe captain of the fielding side may withdraw an appeal only after obtaining the consent of the umpire within whose \\\\njurisdiction the appeal falls. If such consent is given, the umpire concerned shall, if applicable, revoke the decision \\\\nand recall the batter. \\\\nThe withdrawal of an appeal must be before the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery or, if the \\\\ninnings has been completed, the instant when the umpires leave the field. \\\\n32 BOWLED \\\\n32.1 Out Bowled \\\\n32.1.1 The striker is out Bowled if her wicket is broken by a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a No ball, even if \\\\nit first touches the striker’s bat or person. \\\\n50 \\\\n32.1.2 However, the striker shall not be out Bowled if before striking the wicket the ball has been in contact with any \\\\nother player or an umpire. The striker will, however, be subject to clauses 37 (Obstructing the field), 38 (Run \\\\nout) and 39 (Stumped). \\\\n32.2 Bowled to take precedence \\\\nThe striker is out Bowled if her wicket is broken as in clause 32.1, even though a decision against her for any other \\\\nmethod of dismissal would be justified. \\\\n33 CAUGHT \\\\n33.1 Out Caught \\\\nThe striker is out Caught if a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a No ball, touches her bat without having \\\\npreviously been in contact with any fielder, and is subsequently held by a fielder as a fair catch, as described in \\\\nclauses 33.2 and 33.3, before it touches the ground. \\\\n33.2 A fair catch \\\\n33.2.1 A catch will be fair only if, in every case \\\\neither the ball, at any time \\\\nor any fielder in contact with the ball, \\\\nis not grounded beyond the boundary before the catch is completed. Note clauses 19.4 (Ball grounded \\\\nbeyond the boundary) and 19.5 (Fielder grounded beyond the boundary). \\\\n33.2.2 Furthermore, a catch will be fair if any of the following conditions applies: \\\\n33.2.2.1 the ball is held in the hand or hands of a fielder, even if the hand holding the ball is touching the ground, or \\\\nis hugged to the body, or lodges in the external protective equipment worn by a fielder, or lodges \\\\naccidentally in a fielder’s clothing. \\\\n33.2.2.2 a fielder catches the ball after it has been lawfully struck more than once by the striker, but only if it has not \\\\nbeen grounded since it was first struck. See clause 34 (Hit the ball twice). \\\\n33.2.2.3 a fielder catches the ball after it has touched the wicket, an umpire, another fielder or the other batter. \\\\n \\\\n33.2.2.4 a fielder catches the ball after it has crossed the boundary in the air, provided that the conditions in clause \\\\n33.2.1 are met. \\\\n33.2.2.5 the ball is caught off an obstruction within the boundary that is not designated a boundary by the umpires. \\\\n33.3 Making a catch \\\\nThe act of making a catch shall start from the time when the ball first comes into contact with a fielder’s person and \\\\nshall end when a fielder obtains complete control over both the ball and her own movement. \\\\n33.4 No runs to be scored \\\\nIf the striker is dismissed Caught, runs from that delivery completed by the batters before the completion of the catch \\\\nshall not be scored but any runs for penalties awarded to either side shall stand. The non-striker shall return to his \\\\noriginal end.  See clause 18.11 Batter returning to original end. \\\\n33.5 Caught to take precedence \\\\nIf the criteria of clause 33.1 are met and the striker is not out Bowled, then she is out Caught, even though a decision \\\\nagainst either batter for another method of dismissal would be justified. \\\\n51 \\\\n34 HIT THE BALL TWICE \\\\n34.1 Out Hit the ball twice \\\\n34.1.1 The striker is out Hit the ball twice if, while the ball is in play, it strikes any part of her person or is struck by \\\\nher bat and, before the ball has been touched by a fielder, the striker wilfully strikes it again with her bat or \\\\nperson, other than a hand not holding the bat, except for the sole purpose of guarding her wicket. See \\\\nclause 34.3 and clause 37 (Obstructing the field). \\\\n34.1.2 For the purpose of this clause ‘struck’ or ‘strike’ shall include contact with the person of the striker. \\\\n34.1.3 This clause will apply whether or not No ball is called. \\\\n34.2 Not out Hit the ball twice \\\\nThe striker will not be out under this clause if she: \\\\n34.2.1 strikes the ball a second or subsequent time in order to return the ball to any fielder.  \\\\nNote, however, the provisions of clause 37.4 (Returning the ball to a fielder). \\\\n34.2.2 wilfully strikes the ball after it has touched a fielder. Note, however the provisions of clause 37.1 (Out \\\\nObstructing the field). \\\\n34.3 Ball lawfully struck more than once \\\\nThe striker may, solely in order to guard her wicket and before the ball has been touched by a fielder, lawfully strike \\\\nthe ball a second or subsequent time with the bat, or with any part of her person other than a hand not holding the \\\\nbat. The striker may guard their wicket even if the delivery is a No ball. \\\\nHowever, the striker may not prevent the ball from being caught by striking the ball more than once in defence of her \\\\nwicket. See clause 37.3 (Obstructing a ball from being caught). \\\\n34.4 Runs permitted from ball lawfully struck more than once \\\\nWhen the ball is lawfully struck more than once, as permitted in clause 34.3, if the ball does not become dead for any \\\\nreason, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball as soon as the ball reaches the boundary or at the completion of \\\\nthe first run. However, the umpire shall delay the call of Dead ball to allow the opportunity for a catch to be \\\\ncompleted. \\\\nThe umpire shall \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side; \\\\n- return any not out batter to her original end; \\\\n- signal No ball to the scorers if applicable; and \\\\n- award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging \\\\nto the fielding side). \\\\n34.5 Bowler does not get credit \\\\nThe bowler does not get credit for the wicket. \\\\n35 HIT WICKET \\\\n35.1 Out Hit wicket \\\\n35.1.1 The striker is out Hit wicket if, after the bowler has entered the delivery stride and while the ball is in play, \\\\nher wicket is broken by either the striker’s bat or person as described in clauses 29.2.1.2 to 29.2.1.4 \\\\n(Breaking the wicket fairly) in any of the following circumstances: \\\\n52 \\\\n35.1.1.1 in the course of any action taken by her in preparing to receive or in receiving a delivery, \\\\n35.1.1.2 in setting off for the first run immediately after playing or playing at the ball, \\\\n35.1.1.3 if no attempt is made to play the ball, in setting off for the first run, providing that in the opinion of the \\\\numpire this is immediately after the striker has had the opportunity of playing the ball, \\\\n35.1.1.4 in lawfully making a second or further stroke for the purpose of guarding her wicket within the provisions of \\\\nclause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once). \\\\n35.1.2 If the striker breaks her wicket in any of the ways described in clauses 29.2.1.2 to 29.2.1.4 (Breaking the \\\\nwicket fairly)before the bowler has entered the delivery stride, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n35.2 Not out Hit wicket \\\\nThe striker is not out under this clause should her wicket be broken in any of the ways referred to in clause 35.1 if any \\\\nof the following applies: \\\\n- it occurs after the striker has completed any action in receiving the delivery, other than in clauses 35.1.1.2 \\\\nto 35.1.1.4. \\\\n- it occurs when the striker is in the act of running, other than setting off immediately for the first run. \\\\n- it occurs when the striker is trying to avoid being run out or stumped. \\\\n- it occurs when the striker is trying to avoid a throw in at any time. \\\\n- the bowler after entering the delivery stride does not deliver the ball. In this case either umpire shall \\\\nimmediately call and signal Dead ball. See clause 20.4 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball). \\\\n- the delivery is a No ball. \\\\n35.3 Runs scored \\\\nNo runs shall be scored when the striker is dismissed Hit wicket other than the one-run penalty for a Wide and any \\\\naward of 5 Penalty Runs. \\\\n36 LEG BEFORE WICKET \\\\n36.1 Out LBW \\\\nThe striker is out LBW if all the circumstances set out in clauses 36.1.1 to 36.1.5 apply: \\\\n36.1.1 The bowler delivers a ball, not being a No ball \\\\n36.1.2 the ball, if it is not intercepted full-pitch, pitches in line between wicket and wicket or on the off side of the \\\\nstriker’s wicket \\\\n36.1.3 the ball not having previously touched her bat, the striker intercepts the ball, either full-pitch or after pitching, \\\\nwith any part of her person \\\\n36.1.4 the point of impact, even if above the level of the bails, \\\\neither is between wicket and wicket \\\\nor if the striker has made no genuine attempt to play the ball with the bat, is \\\\nbetween wicket and wicket or outside the line of the off stump. \\\\n36.1.5 but for the interception, the ball would have hit the wicket. \\\\n36.2 Interception of the ball \\\\n36.2.1 In assessing points of impact in clauses 36.1.3, 36.1.4 and 36.1.5, only the first interception is to be \\\\nconsidered. \\\\n53 \\\\n36.2.2 In assessing 36.1.3, if the bowler’s end umpire is not satisfied that the ball intercepted the batter’s person \\\\nbefore it touched the bat, the batter shall be given Not out. \\\\n36.2.3 In assessing clause 36.1.5, it is to be assumed that the path of the ball before interception would have \\\\ncontinued after interception, irrespective of whether the ball might have pitched subsequently or not. \\\\n36.3 Off side of wicket \\\\nThe off side of the striker’s wicket shall be determined by the striker’s batting position at the moment the ball comes \\\\ninto play for that delivery. See paragraph 13 of Appendix A. \\\\n37 OBSTRUCTING THE FIELD \\\\n37.1 Out Obstructing the field \\\\n37.1.1 Either batter is out Obstructing the field if, except in the circumstances of clause 37.2, and while the ball is in \\\\nplay, she wilfully attempts to obstruct or distract the fielding side by word or action. See also clause 34 (Hit \\\\nthe ball twice). \\\\n37.1.2 The striker is out Obstructing the field if, except in the circumstances of clause 37.2, in the act of receiving a \\\\nball delivered by the bowler, she wilfully strikes the ball with a hand not holding the bat. This will apply \\\\nwhether it is the first strike or a second or subsequent strike. The act of receiving the ball shall extend both \\\\nto playing at the ball and to striking the ball more than once in defence of her wicket. \\\\n37.1.3 This clause will apply whether or not No ball is called. \\\\n37.1.4 For the avoidance of doubt, if an umpire feels that a batter, in running between the wickets, has significantly \\\\nchanged her direction without probable cause and thereby obstructed a fielder’s attempt to effect a run out, \\\\nthe batter should, on appeal, be given out, obstructing the field. It shall not be relevant whether a run out \\\\nwould have occurred or not. \\\\nIf the change of direction involves the batter crossing the pitch, clause 41.14 shall also apply. \\\\nSee also paragraph 2.2 of Appendix D. \\\\n37.2 Not out Obstructing the field \\\\nA batter shall not be out Obstructing the field if \\\\nobstruction or distraction is accidental, or \\\\nobstruction is in order to avoid injury, or \\\\nin the case of the striker, she makes a second or subsequent strike to guard her wicket lawfully as in clause 34.3 (Ball \\\\nlawfully struck more than once). However, see clause 37.3. \\\\n37.3 Obstructing a ball from being caught \\\\n37.3.1 If the delivery is not a No ball, the striker is out Obstructing the field if wilful obstruction or distraction by \\\\neither batter prevents the striker being out Caught.  \\\\n37.3.2 Clause 37.3.1 shall apply even if an obstruction is caused by the striker in lawfully guarding her wicket under \\\\nthe provision of Clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once).  \\\\n37.3.3 If an obstruction or distraction takes place from a No ball then the batter who caused the obstruction or \\\\ndistraction will be out Obstructing the field.  \\\\nHowever, the striker is not out if the obstruction of a catch occurs while defending his/her wicket from a No ball with a \\\\nlawful second strike. \\\\n54 \\\\n37.4 Returning the ball to a fielder \\\\nEither batter is out Obstructing the field if, at any time while the ball is in play and, without the consent of a fielder, she \\\\nuses the bat or any part of her person to return the ball to any fielder. \\\\n37.5 Runs scored \\\\nWhen either batter is dismissed Obstructing the field, \\\\n37.5.1 unless the obstruction or distraction prevents the striker being out caught, any runs completed by the batters \\\\nbefore the offence shall be scored, together with any one run Penalty for No ball or wide, or any other award \\\\nof 5 Penalty Runs to either side. See clauses 18.6 (Runs awarded for penalties) and 18.8 (Runs scored \\\\nwhen a batter is dismissed). \\\\n37.5.2 if the obstruction or distraction prevents the striker from being out caught, any runs completed by the batters \\\\nshall not be scored but any award of 5 Penalty runs to either side shall stand. Clause 18.11 (Batter returning \\\\nto original end) will apply. \\\\n37.6 Bowler does not get credit \\\\nThe bowler does not get credit for the wicket. \\\\n38 RUN OUT \\\\n38.1 Out Run out \\\\nEither batter is out Run out, except as in clause 38.2, if, at any time while the ball is in play, \\\\nshe is out of her ground \\\\nand her wicket is fairly broken by either the action of a fielder or \\\\nthe ball rebounding off a fielder’s person \\\\neven though No ball has been called, except in the circumstances of clause 38.2.2.2, and whether or not a run is \\\\nbeing attempted. \\\\n38.2 Batter not out Run out \\\\n38.2.1 A batter is not out Run out in the circumstances of clauses 38.2.1.1 or 38.2.1.2. \\\\n38.2.1.1 She has been within her ground and has subsequently left it to avoid injury, when the wicket is fairly \\\\nbroken. \\\\nNote also the provisions of clause 30.1.2 (When out of her ground). \\\\n38.2.1.2 The ball, delivered by the bowler, has not made contact with a fielder before the wicket is fairly broken. \\\\n38.2.2 The striker is not out Run out in any of the circumstances in clauses 38.2.2.1 and 38.2.2.2. \\\\n38.2.2.1 She is out Stumped. See clause 39.1.2 (Out Stumped). \\\\n38.2.2.2 No ball has been called \\\\nand she is out of her ground not attempting a run \\\\nand the wicket is fairly broken by the wicket-keeper without the intervention of another fielder. \\\\n38.3 Non-striker leaving his/her ground early \\\\n38.3.1   If the non-striker is out of his/her ground at any time from the moment the ball comes into play until the \\\\ninstant when the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball, the non-striker is liable to be Run out \\\\nby the bowler attempting to run him/her out. In these circumstances, the non- striker will be out Run out if he/she is \\\\nout of his/her ground when his/her wicket is broken by the bowler throwing the ball at the wicket or by the bowler’s \\\\nhand holding the ball, whether or not the ball is subsequently delivered. \\\\n55 \\\\n38.3.2 If the ball is not delivered, \\\\n- if there is an appeal, the umpire shall make his/her decision on the Run out.  \\\\n- if there is no appeal, or if the decision is not out, he/she shall call and signal Dead ball as soon as possible. \\\\n- the ball shall not count as one in the over. \\\\n38.3.3 If the ball is delivered and there is an appeal, \\\\n- the umpire shall make his/her decision on the Run out. \\\\n- if the non-striker is not dismissed, the ball remains in play and clause 21.6\\\\n (Bowler breaking wicket in delivering ball) shall apply. \\\\n-  if the non-striker is dismissed, the ball shall not count as one in the over. \\\\n38.4 Which batter is out \\\\nThe batter out in the circumstances of clause 38.1 is the one whose ground is at the end where the wicket is fairly \\\\nbroken. See clause 30.2 (Which is a batter’s ground). \\\\n38.5 Runs scored \\\\nIf either batter is dismissed Run out, the run in progress when the wicket is fairly broken shall not be scored, but any \\\\nruns completed by the batters shall stand, together with any runs for penalties awarded to either side. See clauses \\\\n18.6 (Runs awarded for penalties) and 18.8 (Runs scored when a batter is dismissed). \\\\n38.6 Bowler does not get credit \\\\nThe bowler does not get credit for the wicket. \\\\n39 STUMPED \\\\n39.1 Out Stumped \\\\n39.1.1 The striker is out Stumped, except as in clause 39.3, if: \\\\na ball which is delivered is not called No ball \\\\nand she is out of her ground, other than as in clause 39.3.1 \\\\nand she has not attempted a run \\\\nwhen her wicket is fairly broken by the wicket-keeper without the intervention of another fielder. Note, \\\\nhowever clause 27.3 (Position of wicket-keeper). \\\\n39.1.2 The striker is out Stumped if all the conditions of clause 39.1.1 are satisfied, even though a decision of Run \\\\nout would be justified. \\\\n39.2 Ball rebounding from wicket-keeper’s person \\\\nIf the wicket is broken by the ball, it shall be regarded as having been broken by the wicket-keeper if the ball \\\\nrebounds on to the stumps from any part of the wicket-keeper’s person or equipment or has been kicked or thrown on \\\\nto the stumps by the wicket-keeper. \\\\n39.3 Not out Stumped \\\\n39.3.1 The striker will not be out Stumped if, after having received the delivery, she has left her ground in order to \\\\navoid injury. \\\\n39.3.2 If the striker is not out Stumped she may, except in the circumstances of clause 38.2.2.2 (Batter not out Run \\\\nout), be out Run out if the conditions of clause 38.1 (Out Run out) apply. \\\\n56 \\\\n39.4 Runs Scored \\\\nWhen a striker is dismissed Stumped from a Wide ball, the one-run penalty shall stand. Note clauses 12.9 \\\\n(Conclusion of match), 16.6 (Winning hit or extras) and 22.2 (Call and signal of Wide ball) mean that if the penalty for \\\\na Wide concludes the match, then a stumping is not possible, but the one-run penalty for the Wide remains. \\\\n40 TIMED OUT \\\\n40.1 Out Timed out \\\\n40.1.1 After the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, the incoming batter must, unless Time has been called, \\\\nbe ready to receive the ball or for the other batter to be ready to receive the next ball within 2 minutes of the \\\\ndismissal or retirement. If this requirement is not met, the incoming batter will be out, Timed out. \\\\n40.1.2 In the event of an extended delay in which no batter comes to the wicket, the umpires shall adopt the \\\\nprocedure of clause 16.2 (ICC Match Referee awarding a match). For the purposes of that clause the start \\\\nof the action shall be taken as the expiry of the 2 minutes referred to above. \\\\n40.2 Bowler does not get credit \\\\nThe bowler does not get credit for the wicket. \\\\n41 UNFAIR PLAY \\\\n41.1 Fair and unfair play - responsibility of captains \\\\nThe captains are responsible for ensuring that play is conducted within the Spirit of Cricket, as well as within these \\\\nPlaying Conditions. \\\\n41.2 Fair and unfair play - responsibility of umpires \\\\n41.2.1 The umpires shall be the sole judges of fair and unfair play. If either umpire considers that any action by a \\\\nplayer, not covered by these Playing Conditions, is unfair he/she shall call and signal Dead ball, if \\\\nappropriate, as soon as it becomes clear that the call will not disadvantage the non-offending side, and \\\\nreport the matter to the other umpire. \\\\n41.2.1.1 If this is a first offence by that side, the bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- summon the offending player’s captain and issue a first and final warning which shall \\\\napply to all members of the team for the remainder of the match. \\\\n- warn the offending player’s captain that any further such offence by any member of her \\\\nteam shall result in the award of 5 Penalty runs to the opposing team. \\\\n41.2.1.2 If this is a second or subsequent offence by that side, the bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- summon the offending player’s captain and inform her that there has been a further such \\\\noffence. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side. \\\\n41.2.1.3 The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such \\\\naction as is considered appropriate against the player concerned. \\\\n \\\\n41.3 The match ball - changing its condition \\\\n41.3.1 The umpires shall make frequent and irregular inspections of the ball. In addition, they shall immediately \\\\ninspect the ball if they suspect anyone of attempting to change the condition of the ball, except as permitted \\\\nin clause 41.3.2. \\\\n41.3.2 It is an offence for any player to take any action which changes the condition of the ball. \\\\n57 \\\\nExcept in carrying out her normal duties, a batter is not allowed to wilfully damage the ball other than, when \\\\nthe ball is in play, in striking it with the bat. See also clause 5.5 (Damage to the ball). \\\\nA fielder may, however: \\\\n41.3.2.1 polish the ball on her clothing provided that no artificial substance is used, that the only natural \\\\nsubstance used is sweat, and that such polishing wastes no time. \\\\n41.3.2.2 remove mud from the ball under the supervision of an umpire. \\\\n41.3.2.3 dry a wet ball on a piece of cloth that has been approved by the umpires. \\\\n41.3.3 The umpires shall consider the condition of the ball to have been unfairly changed if any action by any \\\\nplayer does not comply with the conditions in clause 41.3.2. \\\\n41.3.4 If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly changed by a member or \\\\nmembers of either side, or that its condition is inconsistent with the use it has received, they shall consider \\\\nthat there has been a contravention of this clause and decide together whether they can identify the \\\\nplayer(s) responsible for such conduct. \\\\n41.3.5 If it is possible to identify the player(s) responsible for changing the condition of the ball, the umpires shall: \\\\n41.3.5.1 Subject to clause 41.3.7 below, change the ball forthwith.  \\\\n41.3.5.1.1 If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly changed \\\\nby a member or members of the fielding side, the batter at the wicket shall choose \\\\nthe replacement ball from a selection of six other balls of various degrees of usage \\\\n(including a new ball) and of the same brand as the ball in use prior to the \\\\ncontravention. \\\\n41.3.5.1.2 If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly changed \\\\nby a member or members of the batting side, the umpires shall select and bring into \\\\nuse immediately, a ball which shall have wear comparable to that of the previous ball \\\\nimmediately prior to the contravention. \\\\n41.3.5.2 Additionally, the bowler’s end umpire shall: \\\\n41.3.5.2.1 award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side. \\\\n41.3.5.2.2 if appropriate, inform the batters at the wicket and the captain of the fielding side that \\\\nthe ball has been changed and the reason for their action; and \\\\n41.3.5.2.3 inform the captain of the batting side as soon as practicable of what has occurred. \\\\n \\\\n41.3.5.3 The umpires shall then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the player(s) concerned. \\\\n41.3.6 If it is not possible to identify the player(s) responsible for changing the condition of the ball, the umpires \\\\nshall: \\\\n41.3.6.1 Change the ball forthwith. The umpires shall choose the replacement ball for one of similar wear \\\\nand of the same brand as the ball in use prior to the contravention. \\\\n41.3.6.2 The bowler’s end umpire shall issue the captain with a first and final warning, and \\\\n41.3.6.3 Advise the captain that should there be any further instances of changing the condition of the ball \\\\nby that team during the remainder of the series, clause 41.3.5.2 above will be adopted, with the \\\\ncaptain deemed to be the player responsible for the contravention. \\\\n41.4 Deliberate attempt to distract striker \\\\n41.4.1 It is unfair for any fielder deliberately to attempt to distract the striker while she is preparing to receive or \\\\nreceiving a delivery. \\\\n41.4.2 If either umpire considers that any action by a fielder is such an attempt, he/she shall immediately call and \\\\nsignal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. The bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\n58 \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side, the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting \\\\nside of the reason for the action. \\\\nNeither batter shall be dismissed from that delivery and the ball shall not count as one of the over. However, \\\\nif either umpire had reason to call and signal No ball, he/she shall do so regardless of the attempt to distract, \\\\nand this call shall stand. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the fielder concerned. \\\\n41.5 Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter \\\\n41.5.1 In addition to clause 41.4, it is unfair for any fielder wilfully to attempt, by word or action, to distract, deceive \\\\nor obstruct either batter after the striker has received the ball. \\\\n41.5.2 It is for either one of the umpires to decide whether any distraction, deception or obstruction is wilful or not. \\\\n41.5.3 If either umpire considers that a fielder has caused or attempted to cause such a distraction, deception or \\\\nobstruction, he/she shall immediately call and signal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for \\\\nthe call. \\\\n41.5.4 Neither batter shall be dismissed from that delivery. \\\\n41.5.5 If an obstruction involves physical contact, the umpires together shall decide whether or not an offence \\\\nunder clause 42 (Players’ conduct) has been committed. \\\\n41.5.5.1 If an offence under clause 42 (Players’ conduct) has been committed, they shall apply the relevant \\\\nprocedures in clause 42 and shall also apply each of clauses 41.5.7 to 41.5.9. \\\\n41.5.5.2 If they consider that there has been no offence under clause 42 (Players’ conduct), they shall apply each \\\\nof clauses 41.5.6 to 41.5.10. \\\\n41.5.6 The bowler’s end umpire shall; \\\\n- Signal No ball or Wide to the scorers, if applicable. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action and as soon as practicable inform the \\\\ncaptain of the batting side. \\\\n41.5.7 The ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n41.5.8 Any runs completed by the batters before the offence shall be scored, together with any runs for penalties \\\\nawarded to either side. Additionally, the run in progress shall be scored whether or not the batters had \\\\nalready crossed at the instant of the offence. \\\\n41.5.9 The batters at the wicket shall decide which of them is to face the next delivery. \\\\n41.5.10 The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the fielder concerned. \\\\n41.6 Bowling of dangerous and unfair short pitched deliveries \\\\n41.6.1 Notwithstanding clause 41.6.2, the bowling of short pitched deliveries is dangerous if the bowler’s end \\\\numpire considers that, taking into consideration the skill of the striker, by their speed, length, height and \\\\ndirection they are likely to inflict physical injury on her. The fact that the striker is wearing protective \\\\nequipment shall be disregarded. \\\\nIn the first instance the umpire decides that the bowling of short pitched deliveries has become dangerous \\\\nunder 41.6.1: \\\\n59 \\\\n41.6.1.1 The umpire shall call and signal No ball, and when the ball is dead, caution the bowler and inform the other \\\\numpire, the captain of the fielding side and the batters of what has occurred. This caution shall apply to \\\\nthat bowler throughout the innings. \\\\n41.6.1.2 If there is a second instance, the umpire shall repeat the above procedure and indicate to the bowler that \\\\nthis is a final warning, which shall apply to that bowler throughout the innings. \\\\n41.6.1.3 Should there be any further instance by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall: \\\\n- call and signal No ball \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately \\\\nfrom bowling \\\\n- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any \\\\npart of the previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\n- The umpire shall inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting \\\\nside. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as \\\\nis considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.6.2 A bowler shall be limited to two fast short-pitched deliveries per over. \\\\n41.6.3 A fast short-pitched delivery is defined as a ball, which passes or would have passed above the shoulder \\\\nheight of the striker standing upright at the popping crease. \\\\n41.6.4 The umpire at the bowler’s end shall advise the bowler and the batter on strike when each fast short pitched \\\\ndelivery has been bowled. \\\\n41.6.5 In addition, a ball that passes above head height of the batter, standing upright at the popping crease, that \\\\nprevents her from being able to hit it with her bat by means of a normal cricket stroke shall be called a Wide. \\\\nSee also clause 22.1.1.2 \\\\n41.6.5.1 For the avoidance of doubt any fast short pitched delivery that is called a Wide under this playing condition \\\\nshall also count as one of the allowable short pitched deliveries in that over. \\\\n41.6.6 In the event of a bowler bowling more than two fast short-pitched deliveries in an over as defined in clause \\\\n41.6.3 above, the umpire at the bowler’s end shall call and signal No ball on each occasion. A differential \\\\nsignal shall be used to signify a fast short pitched delivery. The umpire shall call and signal ‘No ball’ and \\\\nthen tap the head with the other hand. \\\\n41.6.7 If a bowler delivers a third fast short pitched ball in an over, the umpire, after the call of No ball and when the \\\\nball is dead, shall caution the bowler, inform the other umpire, the captain of the fielding side and the batters \\\\nat the wicket of what has occurred. This caution shall apply throughout the innings. \\\\n41.6.8 If there is a second instance of the bowler being No balled in the innings for bowling more than two fast short \\\\npitched deliveries in an over, the umpire shall advise the bowler that this is her final warning for the innings. \\\\n41.6.9 Should there be any further instance by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall: \\\\n60 \\\\n- call and signal No ball \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately \\\\nfrom bowling \\\\n- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any \\\\npart of the previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\n- The umpire shall inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting \\\\nside. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as \\\\nis considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.6.10 Should the umpires initiate the caution and warning procedures set out in clauses 41.6.1.3, 41.6.9, and 41.7, \\\\nsuch cautions and warnings are not to be cumulative. \\\\n41.7 Bowling of dangerous and unfair non-pitching deliveries \\\\n41.7.1 Any delivery, which passes or would have passed, without pitching, above waist height of the striker \\\\nstanding upright at the popping crease, is to be deemed to be unfair, whether or not it is likely to inflict \\\\nphysical injury on the striker. If the bowler bowls such a delivery the umpire shall immediately call and signal \\\\nNo ball. \\\\nIf, in the opinion of the umpire, such a delivery is considered likely to inflict physical injury on the batter by its \\\\nspeed and direction, it shall be considered dangerous. When the ball is dead the umpire shall caution the \\\\nbowler, indicating that this is a first and final warning. The umpire shall also inform the other umpire, the \\\\ncaptain of the fielding side and the batters of what has occurred. This caution shall apply to that bowler \\\\nthroughout the innings. \\\\n41.7.2 Should there be any further instance (where a dangerous non-pitching delivery is bowled and is considered \\\\nlikely to inflict physical injury on the batter) by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall: \\\\n- call and signal No ball \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from \\\\nbowling \\\\n- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the \\\\nprevious over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\nAdditionally the umpire shall \\\\n- report the occurrence to the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.7.3 The warning sequence in clauses 41.7.1 and 41.7.2 is independent of the warning and action sequence in \\\\nclause 41.6. \\\\n41.7.4 If the umpire considers that a bowler deliberately bowled a high full-pitched delivery, deemed to be \\\\ndangerous and unfair as defined in clause 41.7.1, then the caution and warning in clause 41.7.1 shall be \\\\ndispensed with. The umpire shall \\\\n- immediately call and signal No ball. \\\\n61 \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from \\\\nbowling and inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the \\\\nprevious over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\n- report the occurrence to the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.8 Bowling of deliberate front-foot No ball \\\\nIf the umpire considers that the bowler has delivered a deliberate front-foot No ball, he/she shall: \\\\n- immediately call and signal No ball. \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling \\\\n- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the previous \\\\nover, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\n- report the occurrence to the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.9 Time wasting by the fielding side \\\\n41.9.1 It is unfair for any fielder to waste time. \\\\n41.9.2 If either umpire considers that the progress of an over is unnecessarily slow, or time is being wasted in any \\\\nother way, by the captain of the fielding side or by any other fielder, at the first instance the umpire \\\\nconcerned shall: \\\\n- if the ball is in play, call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of what has occurred. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then: \\\\n- warn the captain of the fielding side, indicating that this is a first and final warning. \\\\n- inform the batters of what has occurred. \\\\n41.9.3 If either umpire considers that there is any further waste of time in that innings by any fielder, the umpire \\\\nconcerned shall: \\\\n- if the ball is in play, call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of what has occurred. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side and inform the captain of the \\\\nfielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\nAdditionally the umpire shall inform the batters and, as soon as is practicable, the captain of the batting side \\\\nof what has occurred. \\\\n62 \\\\nIf the umpires believe that the act of time wasting was deliberate or repetitive, they may lodge a report under \\\\nthe ICC Code of Conduct. In such circumstances the Captain and/or any individual members of the fielding \\\\nteam responsible for the time wasting will be charged. \\\\n41.10 Batter wasting time \\\\n41.10.1 It is unfair for a batter to waste time. In normal circumstances, the striker should always be ready to take \\\\nstrike when the bowler is ready to start her run-up. \\\\nIn addition, an incoming batter should be in position to take guard or her partner ready to receive the next \\\\nball within 2 minutes of the fall of the previous wicket. \\\\n41.10.2 Should either batter waste time by failing to meet this requirement, or in any other way, the following \\\\nprocedure shall be adopted. At the first instance, either before the bowler starts her run-up or when the ball \\\\nbecomes dead, as appropriate, the umpire shall \\\\n- warn both batters and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall apply throughout the \\\\ninnings. The umpire shall so inform each incoming batter. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of what has occurred. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what \\\\nhas occurred. \\\\n41.10.3 If there is any further time wasting by any batter in that innings, the umpire shall, at the appropriate time \\\\nwhile the ball is dead \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the other batter, the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the \\\\nbatting side of what has occurred. \\\\nIf the umpires believe that the act of time wasting was deemed to be deliberate or repetitive, they may lodge \\\\na report under the ICC Code of Conduct. In such circumstances the batter concerned will be charged. \\\\n41.11 The protected area \\\\nThe protected area is defined as that area of the pitch contained within a rectangle bounded at each end by \\\\nimaginary lines parallel to the popping creases and 5 ft/1.52 m in front of each, and on the sides by imaginary lines, \\\\none each side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps, each parallel to it and 1 ft/30.48 cm \\\\nfrom it. \\\\n41.12 Fielder damaging the pitch \\\\n41.12.1 It is unfair to cause deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch. A fielder will be deemed to be causing \\\\navoidable damage if either umpire considers that her presence on the pitch is without reasonable cause. \\\\n41.12.2 If a fielder causes deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch, other than as in clause 41.13.1, at the first \\\\ninstance the umpire seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire. The \\\\nbowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- caution the captain of the fielding side and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall \\\\napply throughout the innings. \\\\n- inform the batters of what has occurred. \\\\n41.12.3 If, in that innings, there is any further instance of deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch, by any fielder, \\\\nthe umpire seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire. The bowler’s end \\\\numpire shall then \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\n63 \\\\nAdditionally the umpire shall \\\\n- inform the fielding captain of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the fielder concerned. \\\\n41.13 Bowler running on protected area \\\\n41.13.1 It is unfair for a bowler to enter the protected area in her follow-through without reasonable cause, whether \\\\nor not the ball is delivered. \\\\n41.13.2 If a bowler contravenes this clause, at the first instance and when the ball is dead, the umpire shall \\\\n- caution the bowler and inform the other umpire of what has occurred. This caution shall apply to that \\\\nbowler throughout the innings. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and the batters of what has occurred. \\\\n41.13.3 If, in that innings, the same bowler again contravenes this clause, the umpire shall repeat the above \\\\nprocedure indicating that this is a final warning. This warning shall also apply throughout the innings. \\\\n41.13.4 If, in that innings, the same bowler contravenes this clause a third time, when the ball is dead, the umpire \\\\nshall, \\\\n- direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling. If applicable, the \\\\nover shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the previous over, nor \\\\nbe allowed to bowl any part of the next over. The bowler taken off shall not be allowed to bowl again in that \\\\ninnings. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.14 Batter damaging the pitch \\\\n41.14.1 It is unfair to cause deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch. If the striker enters the protected area in \\\\nplaying or playing at the ball, she must move from it immediately thereafter. A batter will be deemed to be \\\\ncausing avoidable damage if either umpire considers that her presence on the pitch is without reasonable \\\\ncause. \\\\n41.14.2 If either batter causes deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch, other than as in clause 41.15, at the first \\\\ninstance the umpire seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the \\\\noccurrence. The bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- warn both batters that the practice is unfair and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning \\\\nshall apply throughout the innings. The umpire shall so inform each incoming batter. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what \\\\nhas occurred. \\\\n41.14.3 If there is any further instance of deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch by any batter in that innings, \\\\nthe umpire seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the occurrence. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\\\n- return any not out batter to her original end \\\\n64 \\\\n- signal No ball or Wide to the scorers if applicable. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. \\\\n- award any other 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective \\\\nhelmets belonging to the fielding side). \\\\n- Inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the \\\\nreason for this action. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the batter concerned. \\\\n41.15 Striker in protected area \\\\n41.15.1 The striker shall not adopt a batting position in the protected area or so close to it that frequent \\\\nencroachment is inevitable. \\\\nThe striker may make a mark on the pitch for the purpose of indicating his/her batting position provided that \\\\nno mark is unreasonably close to the protected area. \\\\n41.15.2 If either umpire considers that the striker is in breach of any of the conditions in clause 41.15.1, if the bowler \\\\nhas not entered the delivery stride, he/she shall immediately call Dead ball, otherwise, wait until the ball is \\\\ndead; he/she shall then inform the other umpire of the occurrence. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then: \\\\n- warn the striker that the practice is unfair and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning \\\\nshall apply throughout the innings. The umpire shall so inform the non-striker and each incoming batter. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what \\\\nhas occurred. \\\\n41.15.3 If there is any further breach of any of the conditions in clause 41.15.1 by any batter in that innings, the \\\\numpire seeing the contravention shall, if the bowler has not entered her delivery stride, immediately call and \\\\nsignal Dead ball, otherwise, he/she shall wait until the ball is dead and then inform the other umpire of the \\\\noccurrence. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\\\n- return any not out batter to her original end \\\\n- signal No ball or Wide to the scorers if applicable. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. \\\\n- award any other 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective \\\\nhelmets belonging to the fielding side). \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the \\\\nreason for this action. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the batter concerned. \\\\n41.16 Batters stealing a run \\\\n41.16.1 It is unfair for the batters to attempt to steal a run during the bowler’s run-up. \\\\nUnless the bowler attempts to run out the non-striker - see clauses 38.3 (Non-striker leaving his/her ground \\\\nearly) - the umpire shall \\\\n65 \\\\n- call and signal Dead ball as soon as the batters cross in such an attempt. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- return the batters to their original ends and disallow the attempted run. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. \\\\n-  award any other 5 run Penalty that is applicable \\\\n- inform the batters, the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting \\\\nside, of the reason for this action. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the batter concerned. \\\\n41.17 Penalty runs \\\\n41.17.1 When Penalty runs are awarded to either side, when the ball is dead the umpire shall signal the Penalty runs \\\\nto the scorers. See clause 2.13 (Signals). \\\\n41.17.2 Penalty runs shall be awarded in each case where these Playing Conditions require the award, even if a \\\\nresult has already been achieved. See clause 16.6 (Winning hit or extras). \\\\nNote, however, that the restrictions on awarding Penalty runs, in clauses 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded), \\\\n34.4 (Runs scored from ball lawfully struck more than once) and 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the \\\\nfielding side), will apply. \\\\n41.17.3 When 5 Penalty runs are awarded to the batting side under any of clauses 24.4 (Player returning without \\\\npermission), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side) or under 41.3, \\\\n41.4, 41.5, 41.9 or 41.12, then \\\\n- they shall be scored as Penalty extras and shall be in addition to any other penalties. \\\\n- they are awarded when the ball is dead and shall not be regarded as runs scored from either the \\\\nimmediately preceding delivery or the immediately following delivery, and shall be in addition to any runs \\\\nfrom those deliveries. \\\\n- the batters shall not change ends solely by reason of the 5 run penalty. \\\\n41.17.4 When 5 Penalty runs are awarded to the fielding side, under clause 18.5.2 (Deliberate short runs), or under \\\\n41.10, 41.14, 41.15 or 41.16, they shall be added as Penalty extras to that side’s total of runs in its most \\\\nrecently completed innings. If the fielding side has not completed an innings, the 5 Penalty runs shall be \\\\nadded to the score in its next innings. \\\\n42 PLAYERS’ CONDUCT \\\\n42.1 Serious misconduct \\\\n42.1.1 The umpires shall act upon any serious misconduct. The relevant offences and the corresponding actions by \\\\nthe umpires are identified in clause 42.2.1. These offences correspond with Level 4 offences in the ICC \\\\nCode of Conduct. Level 1 to Level 3 offences continue to be dealt with separately under the ICC Code of \\\\nConduct. \\\\n42.1.2 If either umpire considers that a player has committed one of these offences at any time during the match, \\\\nthe umpire concerned shall call and signal Dead ball. This call may be delayed until the umpire is satisfied \\\\nthat it will not disadvantage the non-offending side. \\\\n42.1.3 The umpire concerned shall report the matter to the other umpire and together they shall decide whether an \\\\noffence has been committed. The umpires may also consult with the third umpire and the match referee, \\\\n66 \\\\nwho may review any audio or video replays to confirm whether an offence has been committed. If so, the \\\\numpires shall then apply the related sanctions. \\\\n42.1.4 Any call of No ball or Wide before the offence shall stand. \\\\n42.1.5 If the offence is committed by a batter, the umpires shall summon the offending player’s captain to the field. \\\\nSolely for the purpose of this clause, the batters at the wicket may not deputise for their captain. \\\\n42.2 Level 4 offences and action by umpires \\\\n42.2.1 Any of the following actions by a player shall constitute a Level 4 offence: \\\\n- threatening to assault an umpire \\\\n- making inappropriate and deliberate physical contact with an umpire \\\\n- physically assaulting a player or any other person \\\\n- committing any other act of violence. \\\\n42.2.2 If such an offence is committed, 42.2.2.1 to 42.2.2.5 shall be implemented. \\\\n42.2.2.1 The umpire shall call Time. \\\\n42.2.2.2 Together the umpires shall summon and inform the offending player’s captain that an offence at this Level \\\\nhas occurred. \\\\n42.2.2.3 The umpires shall instruct the captain to remove the offending player immediately from the field of play for \\\\nthe remainder of the match and shall apply the following: \\\\n42.2.2.3.1 If the offending player is a fielder, no substitute shall be allowed for her. He is to be \\\\nrecorded as Retired - out at the commencement of any subsequent innings in which \\\\nher team is the batting side. \\\\n42.2.2.3.2 If a bowler is suspended mid-over, then that over must be completed by a different \\\\nbowler, who shall not have bowled the previous over nor shall be permitted to bowl \\\\nthe next over. \\\\n42.2.2.3.3 If the offending player is a batter she is to be recorded as Retired - out in the current \\\\ninnings, unless she has been dismissed under any of clauses 32 to 39, and at the \\\\ncommencement of any subsequent innings in which her team is the batting side. If no \\\\nfurther batter is available to bat, the innings is completed. \\\\n42.2.2.4 As soon as practicable, the umpire shall: \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing team \\\\n- signal the Level 4 penalty to the scorers \\\\n- call Play. \\\\n42.2.2.5 The umpires shall then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee under the ICC Code of Conduct. \\\\n42.3 Captain refusing to remove a player from the field \\\\n42.3.1 If a captain refuses to carry out an instruction under 42.2.2.3, the umpires shall invoke clause 16.3 (Umpires \\\\nawarding a match). \\\\n42.3.2 If both captains refuse to carry out instructions under 42.2.2.3 in respect of the same incident, the umpires \\\\nshall instruct the players to leave the field. The match is not concluded as in clause 12.9 and there shall be \\\\nno result under clause 16. \\\\n42.4 Additional points relating to Level 4 offences \\\\n42.4.1 If a player, while acting as wicket-keeper, commits a Level 4 offence, clause 24.1.2 shall not apply, meaning \\\\nthat only a nominated player may keep wicket, even if another fielder becomes injured or ill and is replaced \\\\nby a substitute. \\\\n67 \\\\n42.4.2 A nominated player who has a substitute will also suffer the penalty for any Level 4 offence committed by \\\\nthe substitute. However, only the substitute will be reported under clause 42.2.2.5. \\\\n68 \\\\nAppendices to ICC Women’s Test Match Playing Conditions \\\\nA. Definitions \\\\nB. Equipment \\\\n1. The bat \\\\n2.

Similarly the umpires always means \\\\nboth umpires and the third umpire.  An umpire and umpires are generalised terms.  Otherwise, a fuller \\\\ndescription indicates which one of the umpires is specifically intended.  Each umpire will be bowler’s end \\\\numpire and striker’s end umpire in alternate overs.  \\\\n5.2 Bowler’s end umpire is the umpire who is standing at the bowler’s end (see paragraph 4.4) for the current \\\\ndelivery. \\\\n5.3 Striker’s end umpire is the umpire who is standing at the striker’s end (see paragraph 4.3), to one side of the \\\\npitch or the other, depending on his/her choice, for the current delivery.     \\\\n71 \\\\n5.4 On-field umpires shall mean, collectively, the bowler’s end umpire and the striker’s end umpire. \\\\n5.5 Third umpire is the umpire who may use television evidence and other available technology in order review a \\\\ndecision of the on-field umpires, either by way of an Umpire Review or a Player Review under the protocol set \\\\nout in Appendix D. \\\\n5.6 Umpires together agree applies to decisions which the umpires are to make jointly, independently of the \\\\nplayers. \\\\n5.7 Decision Review System or DRS is the process covered by the Decision Review System and Third Umpire \\\\nProtocol set out in Appendix D, under which the third umpire may be consulted in relation to a decision of the \\\\non-field umpires, either by way of an Umpire Review or a Player Review. \\\\n5.8 Player Review is the process set out in Appendix D by which a player may request a review of any decision \\\\ntaken by the on-field umpires concerning whether or not a batter is dismissed (with the exception of ‘Timed \\\\nout’). \\\\n5.9 Umpire Review is the process set out in Appendix D by which an on-field umpire has the discretion to refer a \\\\ndecision to the third umpire or, under certain circumstances, to consult with the third umpire before making a \\\\ndecision. \\\\n5.10 Umpire’s Call is the concept within the DRS under which the on-field decision of the bowler’s end umpire \\\\nshall stand, which shall apply under the specific circumstances set out in paragraphs 3.4.5 and 3.4.6 of \\\\nAppendix D, where the ball-tracking technology indicates a marginal decision in respect of either the Impact \\\\nZone or the Wicket Zone. \\\\n5.11 The Pitching Zone as used in the DRS is a two dimensional area on the pitch between both sets of stumps \\\\nwith its boundaries consisting of the base of both sets of stumps and a line between the outside of the outer \\\\nstumps at each end. \\\\n5.12 The Impact Zone as used in the DRS is a three dimensional space extending between both sets of stumps to \\\\nan indefinite height vertically and with its boundaries consisting of the base of the stumps and the outside of \\\\nthe outer stumps at each end. \\\\n5.13 The Wicket Zone as used in the DRS is a two dimensional area with its boundaries consisting of the outside \\\\nof the outer stumps, the base of the stumps, and the  top of the stumps. \\\\n5.14 A Fair Catch is a catch that has been taken cleanly by the fielder in accordance with clause 33. \\\\n5.15 A Bump Ball is where the ball has made contact with the ground shortly after making contact with the striker’s \\\\nbat. \\\\n5.16 The Elite Panel is the group of umpires contracted to the ICC to officiate in international cricket.  \\\\n5.17 The International Panel is the group of umpires nominated by the ICC’s full members in accordance with \\\\nclause 2.1.3 of the Playing Conditions. \\\\n5.18 The First-Class Panel is the group of umpires nominated by the ICC’s full members in accordance with \\\\nclause 2.1.3 of the Playing Conditions. \\\\n5.19 The ICC Development Panel is the group of umpires nominated by the ICC’s full and associate members in \\\\naccordance with clause 2.1.3 of the Playing Conditions. \\\\n5.20 The International Panel of Referees is the group of referees nominated by the ICC’s full members in \\\\naccordance with clause 2.1.6 of the Playing Conditions. \\\\n6 Batters \\\\n6.1 Batting side is the side currently batting, whether or not play is in progress. \\\\n6.2 Member of the batting side is one of the players nominated by the captain of the batting side, or any \\\\nauthorised replacement for such nominated player. \\\\n6.3 The Striker is the batter who receives the ball delivered by the bowler. \\\\n6.4 The non-striker is the batter whose ground is at the bowler’s end when the ball is delivered. \\\\n72 \\\\n6.5 A batter’s ground - at each end of the pitch, the whole area of the field of play behind the popping crease is \\\\nthe ground at that end for a batter. \\\\n6.6 Original end is the end where a batter was when the ball came into play for that delivery. \\\\n6.7 Wicket she has left is the wicket at the end where a batter was at the start of the run in progress. \\\\n6.8 Guard position is the position and posture adopted by the striker to receive a ball delivered by the bowler. \\\\n6.9 For the purposes of these Playing Conditions, waist height is defined as the point at which the top of the \\\\nbatter’s trousers would conventionally be when she is standing upright at the popping crease. \\\\n7 Fielders \\\\n7.1 Fielding side is the side currently fielding, whether or not play is in progress. \\\\n7.2 Member of the fielding side is one of the players nominated by the captain of the fielding side, or any \\\\nauthorised replacement or substitute for such nominated player.  \\\\n7.3 Fielder is one of the 11 or fewer players who together represent the fielding side on the field of play. This \\\\ndefinition includes not only both the bowler and the wicket-keeper but also nominated players who are \\\\nlegitimately on the field of play, together with players legitimately acting as substitutes for absent nominated \\\\nplayers.  It excludes any nominated player who is absent from the field of play, or who has been absent from \\\\nthe field of play and who has not yet obtained the umpire’s permission to return.  \\\\nA player going briefly outside the boundary in the course of discharging her duties as a fielder is not absent \\\\nfrom the field of play nor, for the purposes of clause 24.2 (Fielder absent or leaving the field of play), is she \\\\nto be regarded as having left the field of play. \\\\n8 Substitutes and Replacements \\\\n8.1 A Substitute is a player who takes the place of a fielder on the field of play, but does not replace the player \\\\nfor whom she substitutes on that side’s list of nominated players.  A substitute’s activities are limited to \\\\nfielding. \\\\n8.2 A Concussion Replacement is a player who takes the place of a player who has been replaced in \\\\naccordance with the process set out in clause 1.2.7, and who for the remainder of the match replaces that \\\\nplayer on that side’s list of nominated players, being able to take a full part in the match (subject to such \\\\nrestrictions as may be imposed by the ICC Match Referee in accordance with clause 1.2.7.4 \\\\n8.3 A Concussion Replacement Request is the notification made to the ICC Match Referee in accordance with \\\\nthe process set out in clause 1.2.7.3 \\\\n8.4 The Team Medical Representative is the individual designated as having responsibility for the assessment of \\\\nany head or neck injury sustained by a player as set out in clause 1.2.7 and 1.2.8. \\\\n9 Bowlers \\\\n9.1 Over the wicket / round the wicket - If, as the bowler runs up between the wicket and the return crease, the \\\\nwicket is on the same side as her bowling arm, she is bowling over the wicket.  If the return crease is on the \\\\nsame side as her bowling arm, she is bowling round the wicket. \\\\n9.2 Delivery swing is the motion of the bowler’s arm during which she normally releases the ball for a delivery. \\\\n9.3 Delivery stride is the stride during which the delivery swing is made, whether the ball is released or not.  It \\\\nstarts when the bowler’s back foot lands for that stride and ends when the front foot lands in the same stride.  \\\\nThe stride after the delivery stride is completed when the next foot lands, i.e. when the back foot of the \\\\ndelivery stride lands again. \\\\n9.4 The Illegal Bowling Regulations are the ICC’s regulations governing Illegal Bowling Actions. \\\\n9.5 An Illegal Bowling Action is a bowling action where a bowler’s Elbow Extension exceeds 15 degrees, \\\\nmeasured from the point at which the bowling arm reaches the horizontal until the point at which the ball is \\\\n73 \\\\nreleased (any Elbow Hyperextension shall be discounted for the purposes of determining an Illegal Bowling \\\\nAction). \\\\n9.6 Elbow Extension means the motion that occurs when a bowler\\'s arm moves from a flexed (bent) position at \\\\nthe elbow, to a more extended (straight) position (full Elbow Extension occurs when the arm is straight). \\\\n9.7 Elbow Hyperextension is the motion that occurs when a bowler\\'s elbow extends beyond the straight position. \\\\n9.8 The ICC Bowling Action Report Form is the form provided for by Article 3 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations, \\\\nby which an umpire and/or the ICC Match Referee may submit a report relating to a suspected Illegal Bowling \\\\nAction. \\\\n10 The ball \\\\n10.1 The ball is struck/strikes the ball unless specifically defined otherwise, mean ‘the ball is struck by the \\\\nbat’/‘strikes the ball with the bat’. \\\\n10.2 Full-pitch describes a ball delivered by the bowler that reaches or passes the striker without having touched \\\\nthe ground.  Sometimes described as non-pitching. \\\\n11 Runs \\\\n11.1 A run to be disallowed is one that in these Playing Conditions should not have been taken.  It is not only to \\\\nbe cancelled but the batters are to be returned to their original ends.   \\\\n11.2 A run not to be scored is one that is not illegal, but is not recognised as a properly executed run.  It is not a \\\\nrun that has been made, so the question of cancellation does not arise.  The loss of the run so attempted is \\\\nnot a disallowance and the batters will not be returned to their original ends on that account.  \\\\n12 The person \\\\n12.1 Person; A player’s person is her physical person (flesh and blood) together with any clothing or legitimate \\\\nexternal protective equipment that she is wearing except, in the case of a batter, her bat. \\\\nA hand, whether gloved or not, that is not holding the bat is part of the batter’s person. \\\\nNo item of clothing or equipment is part of the player’s person unless it is attached to her. \\\\nFor a batter, a glove being held but not worn is part of her person. \\\\nFor a fielder, an item of clothing or equipment she is holding in her hand or hands is not part of her person. \\\\n12.2 Clothing - anything that a player is wearing, including such items as spectacles or jewellery, that is not \\\\nclassed as external protective equipment is classed as clothing, even though she may be wearing some items \\\\nof apparel, which are not visible, for protection.  A bat being carried by a batter does not come within this \\\\ndefinition of clothing. \\\\n12.3 Hand for batter or wicket-keeper shall include both the hand itself and the whole of a glove worn on the hand. \\\\n74 \\\\n13 Off side / on side; in front of / behind the popping crease. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n75 \\\\nAppendix B  \\\\n \\\\nEquipment  \\\\n1 The Bat \\\\n1.1 General guidance \\\\n1.1.1 Measurements - All provisions in paragraphs 1.2 to 1.6 below are subject to the measurements and \\\\nrestrictions stated in the Playing Conditions and this Appendix. \\\\n1.1.2 Adhesives - Throughout, adhesives are permitted only where essential and only in minimal quantity. \\\\n1.2 Specifications for the Handle \\\\n1.2.1 One end of the handle is inserted into a recess in the blade as a means of joining the handle and the blade. \\\\nThis lower portion is used purely for joining the blade and the handle together.  It is not part of the blade but, \\\\nsolely in interpreting paragraphs 1.3 and 1.4 below, references to the blade shall be considered to extend \\\\nalso to this lower portion of the handle where relevant. \\\\n1.2.2 The handle may be glued where necessary and bound with twine along the upper portion.  \\\\nProviding clause 5.5 is not contravened, the upper portion may be covered with materials solely to provide a \\\\nsurface suitable for gripping.  Such covering is an addition and is not part of the bat, except in relation to \\\\nclause 5.6.  The bottom of this grip should not extend below the point defined in paragraph 1.2.4 below. \\\\nTwine binding and the covering grip may extend beyond the junction of the upper and lower portions of the \\\\nhandle, to cover part of the shoulders of the bat as defined in paragraph 1.3.1. \\\\nNo material may be placed on or inserted into the lower portion of the handle other than as permitted above \\\\ntogether with the minimal adhesives or adhesive tape used solely for fixing these items, or for fixing the \\\\nhandle to the blade. \\\\n1.2.3 Materials in handle - As a proportion of the total volume of the handle, materials other than cane, wood or \\\\ntwine are restricted to one-tenth. Such materials must not project more than 3.25 in/8.26 cm into the lower \\\\nportion of the handle \\\\n1.2.4 Binding and covering of handle - The permitted continuation beyond the junction of the upper and lower \\\\nportions of the handle is restricted to a maximum, measured along the length of the handle, of  \\\\n2.5 in/6.35 cm in for the twine binding \\\\n2.75 in/6.99 cm for the covering grip. \\\\n1.3 Specifications for the Blade \\\\n1.3.1 The blade has a face, a back, a toe, sides and shoulders \\\\n1.3.1.1 The face of the blade is its main striking surface and shall be flat or have a slight convex curve \\\\nresulting from traditional pressing techniques.  The back is the opposite surface. \\\\n1.3.1.2 The shoulders, sides and toe are the remaining surfaces, separating the face and the back. \\\\n1.3.1.3 The shoulders, one on each side of the handle, are along that portion of the blade between the first \\\\nentry point of the handle and the point at which the blade first reaches its full width. \\\\n1.3.1.4 The toe is the surface opposite to the shoulders taken as a pair. \\\\n1.3.1.5 The sides, one each side of the blade, are along the rest of the blade, between the toe and the \\\\nshoulders. \\\\n76 \\\\n1.3.2 No material may be placed on or inserted into the blade other than as permitted in paragraph 1.2.4, \\\\nparagraph 1.3.3, and clause 5.4 together with the minimal adhesives or adhesive tape used solely for fixing \\\\nthese items, or for fixing the handle to the blade. \\\\n1.3.3 Covering the blade. Bats shall have no covering on the blade except as permitted in clause 5.4.   \\\\nAny materials referred to above, in clause 5.4 and paragraph 1.4 below, are to be considered as part of the \\\\nbat, which must still pass through the gauge as defined in paragraph 1.6. \\\\n1.4 Protection and repair  \\\\n1.4.1 The surface of the blade may be treated with non-solid materials to improve resistance to moisture \\\\npenetration and/or mask natural blemishes in the appearance of the wood.  Save for the purpose of giving a \\\\nhomogeneous appearance by masking natural blemishes, such treatment shall not materially alter the colour \\\\nof the blade.  \\\\n1.4.2 Materials can be used for protection and repair as stated in clause 5.4 and are additional to the blade. Note \\\\nhowever clause 5.6. \\\\nAny such material shall not extend over any part of the back of the blade except in the case of clause 5.4.1 \\\\nand then only when it is applied as a continuous wrapping covering the damaged area. \\\\nThe repair material shall not extend along the length of the blade more than 0.79 in/2.0 cm in each direction \\\\nbeyond the limits of the damaged area.  Where used as a continuous binding, any overlapping shall not \\\\nbreach the maximum of 0.04 in/0.1 cm in total thickness. \\\\nThe use of non-solid material which when dry forms a hard layer more than 0.004 in/0.01 cm in thickness is \\\\nnot permitted. \\\\n1.4.3 Permitted coverings, repair material and toe guards, not exceeding their specified thicknesses, may be \\\\nadditional to the dimensions above, but the bat must still pass through the gauge as described in paragraph \\\\n1.6. \\\\n1.5 Commercial identifications  \\\\nSuch identifications shall comply with the restrictions set out in the Clothing and Equipment Regulations in \\\\nrelation to the size and position of marks and logos. \\\\n1.6 Bat Gauge \\\\nAll bats must meet the specifications defined in clause 5.7. They must also, with or without protective \\\\ncoverings permitted in clause 5.4, be able to pass through a bat gauge, the dimensions and shape of which \\\\nare shown in the following diagram: \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n77 \\\\n2 The wickets \\\\n \\\\n2.1 Bails \\\\nOverall 4.31 in / 10.95 cm \\\\na = 1.38 in / 3.50 cm \\\\nb = 2.13 in / 5.40 cm \\\\nc = 0.81 in / 2.06 cm \\\\n2.2 Stumps \\\\nHeight (d) = 28 in / 71.1 cm \\\\nDiameter (e) - maximum = 1.5 in / 3.81 cm; minimum = 1.38 in / 3.50 cm \\\\n2.3 Overall \\\\nWidth (f) of wicket 9 in / 22.86 cm \\\\n3 Wicket-keeping gloves \\\\n3.1 The images below illustrate the requirements of clause 27.2 in relation to: \\\\n• no webbing between the fingers; \\\\n• a single piece of non-stretch material between finger and thumb as a means of support; and \\\\n• when a hand wearing the glove has the thumb fully extended, the top edge being taut and not \\\\nprotruding beyond the straight line joining the top of the index finger to the top of the thumb. \\\\n\\\\n78 \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n3.2 Note also the requirement for wicket-keeping gloves to comply with the Clothing and Equipment Regulations \\\\nin relation to the size and position of marks and logos. \\\\n4 Helmets and Neck Protectors \\\\n \\\\n4.1     Players must wear a helmet in the following circumstances where: \\\\n- batters are facing pace bowlers, \\\\n- wicket keepers are standing up to the stumps, and \\\\n- fielding close to the batter in front of the wicket \\\\n4.2     All helmets must be certified (BS7928:2013) helmets. \\\\n4.3     At other times helmets are optional.  However, if a helmet is worn, it also must be a certified  \\\\n(BS7928:2013) helmet. \\\\n4.4     The use of a neck protector when batting in International Cricket is optional. \\\\n\\\\n79 \\\\nAppendix C  \\\\n \\\\nThe venue  \\\\n1 The pitch and the creases \\\\n \\\\n2 Advertising on grounds, perimeter boards and sight-\\\\nscreens \\\\n2.1 Advertising on grounds \\\\n2.1.1 The logos on outfields are to be positioned as follows:   \\\\n(a) Behind the stumps - a minimum of 25.15 yards (23 meters) from the stumps.   \\\\n(b) Midwicket/cover area - no advertising to be positioned within 30 yards (27.50 meters) of the centre \\\\nof the pitch being used for the match.    \\\\n2.1.2 Note: Advertising closer to the stumps as set out above which is required to meet 3D requirements for \\\\nbroadcasters may be permitted, subject to prior ICC approval having been obtained.  \\\\n2.2 Perimeter boards \\\\n2.2.1 Advertising on perimeter boards placed in front of the sight-screens is permitted save that the predominant \\\\ncolour of such advertising shall be of a contrasting colour to that of the ball.  \\\\n2.2.2 Advertising on perimeter boards behind the stumps at both ends shall not contain moving, flashing or \\\\nflickering images and operators should ensure that the images are only changed or moved at a time that will \\\\nnot be distracting to the players or the umpires.    \\\\n2.2.3 The brightness of any electronic images shall be set at a level so that it is not a distraction to the players or \\\\numpires. \\\\n\\\\n80 \\\\n2.3 Sight-screens   \\\\n2.3.1 Sight-screens shall be provided at both ends of all grounds. For day-night Test matches, they will be white \\\\nor black as determined by the Home Board. \\\\n2.3.2 Advertising shall be permitted on the sight-screen behind the striker, providing it is removed for the \\\\nsubsequent over from that end. \\\\n2.3.3 Such advertising shall not contain flashing or flickering images and particular care should be taken by the \\\\noperators that the advertising is not changed at a time which is distracting to the umpire. \\\\n3 Markings on outfield \\\\nWith the permission of the Ground Authority, a bowler may use paint to make a small marking on the outfield \\\\nfor the purposes of identifying their run-up. Paint used for this purpose shall be any colour other than white. \\\\n81 \\\\nAppendix D  \\\\n \\\\nDecision Review System (DRS) and Third Umpire Protocol  \\\\n1 General \\\\n1.1 Minimum requirements for use of DRS and appointment of third umpire \\\\n1.1.1 The Home Board shall endeavour to broadcast all Test Matches played in its country. \\\\n1.1.2 Where matches are broadcast, the camera specification set out below shall be mandatory as a minimum \\\\nrequirement. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n1.1.3 Where the camera specification set out above is provided, a third umpire shall be appointed to the match. \\\\n1.1.4 If the minimum requirements for DRS to be used are satisfied, both participating Boards may agree to \\\\nemploy the DRS for a Test series. Otherwise, the third umpire shall be appointed and empowered to use \\\\nbroadcast replays to make decisions that are referred to him/her in accordance with paragraph 2 (Umpire \\\\nReviews). \\\\n1.1.5 The table below summarises the minimum requirements for DRS to be used, and the recommended \\\\nregulations around the appointment of the third umpire: \\\\n Third Umpire (non-DRS) DRS \\\\nMinimum \\\\nRequirement \\\\nCameras Specification detailed in \\\\nparagraph 1.1.2. \\\\nCameras \\\\n- Specification detailed in paragraph \\\\n1.1.2. Technology \\\\n- Approved ball-tracking technology. \\\\n- Approved sound-based edge \\\\ndetection technology. \\\\nThird Umpire \\\\nAppointment \\\\nAppointed by Home Board from an ICC \\\\nPanel or First Class Panel of umpires. \\\\nAppointed by the Home Board from an ICC \\\\nPanel of umpires. \\\\nThird Umpire \\\\nJurisdiction \\\\nUmpire Reviews only Umpire Reviews and Player Reviews \\\\n\\\\n82 \\\\nReplays that \\\\ncan be used \\\\nThe third umpire shall only have access \\\\nto replays of any camera images. Other \\\\ntechnology which may be in use by the \\\\nbroadcaster for broadcast purposes (for \\\\nexample, ball-tracking technology, sound-\\\\nbased edge detection technology, and \\\\nheat-based edge detection technology) \\\\nshall not be used during Umpire Reviews. \\\\nAny replay, stump microphone audio or \\\\ntechnology detailed in paragraph 3.8.1 \\\\nbelow. \\\\nICC Technical \\\\nOfficer \\\\nNot required. The Home Board shall appoint an \\\\nindependent technology expert (ICC \\\\nTechnical Officer) to be present at every \\\\nseries in which the DRS is used to assist \\\\nthe third umpire and to protect the integrity \\\\nof the DRS process. \\\\n \\\\n1.1.6 The Home Board shall ensure that a separate room is provided for the third umpire and that he/she has \\\\naccess to the television equipment and technology (where DRS is used) so as to be in the best position to \\\\nfacilitate the referral and/or consultation processes referred to in paragraphs 2 (Umpire Review) and 3 \\\\n(Player Review) below. \\\\n2 Umpire Review \\\\nIn the circumstances detailed in paragraphs 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 below, the on-field umpire shall have the \\\\ndiscretion to refer the decision to the third umpire or, in the case of paragraphs 2.2, and 2.4, to consult with \\\\nthe third umpire before making the decision.  \\\\nFor televised matches, in line with clause 21.5, the third umpire shall already have reviewed television \\\\nreplays of the bowler’s feet landing and, where satisfied that not all the requirements have been met, shall \\\\nimmediately have advised the bowler’s end umpire (who shall in turn have immediately called and signalled \\\\nNo ball). Accordingly, paragraphs 2 (Umpire Review) and 3 (Player Review) of this Appendix D shall operate \\\\non the basis that this element of the referral and/or consultation process has already been undertaken. \\\\nSave for requesting the umpire to review his/her decision under paragraph 3 (Player Review) below, players \\\\nmay not appeal to the on-field umpires to use the Umpire Review. Breach of this provision may constitute \\\\ndissent and the player may be subject to disciplinary action under the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and \\\\nPlayer Support Personnel. \\\\n2.1 Run Out, Stumped, Bowled and Hit Wicket Decisions \\\\n2.1.1 The relevant on-field umpire shall be entitled to refer an appeal for run-out, stumped, bowled or hit wicket to \\\\nthe third umpire. \\\\n2.1.2 An on-field umpire wishing to refer a decision to the third umpire shall signal to the third umpire by making \\\\nthe shape of a TV screen with his/her hands. \\\\n2.1.3 In the case of a referral of a bowled, hit wicket or stumped decision, the third umpire shall first check the \\\\nfairness of the delivery (all modes of No ball except for (i) in respect of the feet, which shall already have \\\\nbeen checked in accordance with clause 21.5; and (ii) the bowler using an Illegal Bowling Action, subject to \\\\nthe proviso that the third umpire may review whether the bowler has used a prohibited Specific Variation \\\\nunder Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations). If the delivery was not a fair delivery the third umpire \\\\nshall indicate that the batter is Not out and advise the on-field umpire to signal No ball. See also paragraph \\\\n2.6 below. \\\\n2.1.4 Additionally, if on review of a run out, bowled or hit wicket, the third umpire finds the batter is Out by another \\\\nmode of dismissal (excluding LBW), or Not out by any mode of dismissal (excluding LBW), he/she shall \\\\nnotify the on-field umpire so that the correct decision is made. \\\\n2.1.5 If the third umpire decides that the batter is Out, a red light shall be displayed; if the third umpire decides that \\\\nthe batter is Not out, a green light shall be displayed. Should the third umpire be temporarily unable to \\\\n83 \\\\nrespond, a white light (where available) shall remain illuminated throughout the period of interruption to \\\\nsignify to the on-field umpires that Umpire Reviews are temporarily unavailable, in which case the decision \\\\nshall be taken by the on-field umpire. As an alternative to the red/green light system, the replay screen \\\\n(where available) may be used for the purpose of conveying the third umpire’s decision, in line with the ICC \\\\nBig Screen Policy. \\\\n2.2 Caught Decisions, Obstructing the Field \\\\n2.2.1 Where the bowler’s end umpire is unable to decide upon a Fair Catch or a Bump Ball, or if, on appeal from \\\\nthe fielding side, the batter obstructed the field, he/she shall first consult with the striker’s end umpire. \\\\n2.2.2 Should both on-field umpires require assistance from the third umpire to make a decision, the bowler’s end \\\\numpire shall consult by two-way radio with the third umpire followed by making the shape of a TV screen \\\\nwith his/her hands. \\\\n2.2.3 The third umpire shall determine whether the batter has been caught, whether the delivery was a Bump Ball, \\\\nor if the batter obstructed the field. However, in reviewing the television replay(s), the third umpire shall first \\\\ncheck the fairness of the delivery for all decisions involving a catch (any modes of No ball, on request except \\\\nfor (i) in respect of the feet, which shall already have been checked in accordance with clause 21.5; and (ii) \\\\nthe bowler using an Illegal Bowling Action, subject to the proviso that the third umpire may review whether \\\\nthe bowler has used a prohibited Specific Variation under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations) and \\\\nwhether the batter has hit the ball. If the delivery was not a fair delivery he/she shall advise the bowler’s end \\\\numpire to signal No ball. See also paragraph 2.6 below. Additionally, if it is clear to the third umpire that the \\\\nbatter is Out by another mode of dismissal (excluding LBW), or Not out by any mode of dismissal (excluding \\\\nLBW), he/she shall notify the bowler’s end umpire of his/her decision, which will then be displayed on the big \\\\nscreen. \\\\n2.2.4 The third umpire shall communicate his/her decision as set out in paragraph 2.1.5. \\\\n2.3 Boundary Decisions \\\\n2.3.1 The bowler’s end umpire shall be entitled to refer to the third umpire for a decision on: \\\\n2.3.1.1 whether a four or six has been scored; \\\\n2.3.1.2 whether a fielder had any part of her person in contact with the ball when she touched the \\\\nboundary; or \\\\n2.3.1.3 whether the fielder had any part of her person in contact with the ball when she had any part of her \\\\nperson grounded beyond the boundary. \\\\n2.3.1.4   the number of runs scored when a boundary results from an overthrow or the wilful act of a fielder  (see \\\\nclause 19.8) \\\\n2.3.2 A decision shall be made immediately and cannot be changed thereafter. \\\\n2.3.3 If the television evidence is inconclusive as to whether or not a boundary has been scored, the default \\\\npresumption shall be in favour of no boundary being awarded. \\\\n2.3.4 Where the bowler’s end umpire wishes to use the assistance of the third umpire in this circumstance, he/she \\\\nshall communicate with the third umpire by use of a two-way radio and the third umpire shall convey his/her \\\\ndecision to the bowler’s end umpire by the same method. \\\\n2.3.5 The third umpire may initiate contact with the on-field umpire by two-way radio if TV coverage shows a \\\\nboundary line infringement or incident that appears not to have been acted upon by the on-field umpires. \\\\n2.4 Batters Running to the Same End \\\\n2.4.1 Where both batters have run to the same end and the on-field umpires are uncertain over which batter made \\\\nher ground first, the on-field umpires may consult with the third umpire. \\\\n2.4.2 The procedure set out in paragraph 2.3.4 shall apply. \\\\n84 \\\\n2.5 Short run \\\\n2.5.1 The third umpire shall automatically review any call of Short run by an on-field umpire under clauses 18.3 \\\\nand 18.4, communicating with the relevant on-field umpire by two-way radio and conveying his/her decision \\\\nby the same method. \\\\n2.6 No Balls \\\\n2.6.1 If the bowler’s end umpire is uncertain as to the fairness of the delivery following a dismissal, (other than in \\\\nrespect of the feet, which shall have already been checked by the third umpire), either affecting the validity \\\\nof the dismissal or which batter is dismissed, he/she shall be entitled to request the batter to delay leaving \\\\nthe field and to check the fairness of the delivery with the third umpire. Communication with the third umpire \\\\nshall be by two-way radio. \\\\n2.6.2 The third umpire shall check all modes of No ball (other than in respect of feet, which shall have already \\\\nbeen checked except for the bowler using an Illegal Bowling Action (subject to the proviso that the third \\\\numpire may review whether the bowler has used a prohibited Specific Variation under Article 6.2 of the \\\\nIllegal Bowling Regulations). The third umpire shall apply clause 21.5 when deciding whether a No ball \\\\nshould have been called (and must therefore be satisfied that none of the three conditions in clause 21.5 \\\\nhave been met before calling a No ball). \\\\n2.6.3 If the delivery was not a fair delivery, the bowler’s end umpire shall indicate that the batter is Not out and \\\\nsignal No ball (except in the case of a dismissal for obstructing the field, which may still be effected despite a \\\\nNo ball being called, in which case the bowler’s end umpire shall indicate that the relevant batter is Out and \\\\nadditionally call a No ball). \\\\n2.6.4 If a No ball is called following the check by the third umpire, the batting side shall benefit from the reversal of \\\\nthe dismissal and the one run for the No ball, but shall not benefit from any runs that may subsequently have \\\\naccrued from the delivery had the on-field umpire originally called a No ball. Where the batters crossed while \\\\nthe ball was in the air before being caught, the batters shall return to their original ends as if the striker had \\\\nbeen dismissed, but no runs shall be credited to the striker even if one (or more) runs were completed prior \\\\nto the catch being taken. \\\\n2.7 Cameras On or Over the Field of Play \\\\n2.7.1 The on-field umpires shall be entitled to refer to the third umpire for a decision as to whether the ball has at \\\\nany time during the normal course of play come into contact with any part of the camera, its apparatus or its \\\\ncables above the playing area, as contemplated in clause 20.1.3. \\\\n2.7.2 Where an on-field umpire wishes to use the assistance of the third umpire in this circumstance, he/she shall \\\\ncommunicate with the third umpire by use of a two-way radio and the third umpire shall convey his/her \\\\ndecision to the bowler’s end umpire by the same method. \\\\n2.7.3 A decision shall be made immediately and cannot be changed thereafter. If the television evidence is \\\\ninconclusive as to whether or not the ball has come into contact with any part of the camera, its apparatus or \\\\nits cables above the playing area, the default presumption shall be in favour of no contact having been \\\\nmade. \\\\n2.7.4 The third umpire may initiate contact with the on-field umpire by two-way radio if TV coverage shows the ball \\\\nto have been in contact with any part of the camera or its cables above the playing area as envisaged under \\\\nthis paragraph. \\\\n3 Player Review \\\\nThe following paragraphs shall operate in addition to and in conjunction with paragraph 2 (Umpire Review). \\\\n3.1 Circumstances in which a Player Review may be requested \\\\n3.1.1 A player may request a review of any decision taken by the on-field umpires concerning whether or not a \\\\nbatter is dismissed, with the exception of ‘Timed Out’ (Player Review). \\\\n3.1.2 No other decisions made by the umpires are eligible for a Player Review. \\\\n85 \\\\n3.1.3 Only the batter involved in a dismissal may request a Player Review of an Out decision and only the captain \\\\n(or acting captain) of the fielding team may request a Player Review of a Not out decision. \\\\n3.1.4 A decision concerning whether or not a batter is dismissed that could have been the subject of a Umpire \\\\nReview under paragraph 2 is eligible for a Player Review as soon as it is clear that the on-field umpire has \\\\nchosen not to initiate the Umpire Review. \\\\n3.2 The manner of requesting the Player Review \\\\n3.2.1 The request shall be made by the player making a ‘T’ sign with both forearms at head height. \\\\n3.2.2 The total time elapsed between the ball becoming dead and the review request being made shall be no \\\\nmore than 15 seconds. The bowler’s end umpire shall provide the relevant player with a prompt after 10 \\\\nseconds if the request has not been made at that time and the player shall request the review immediately \\\\nthereafter. If the on-field umpires believe that a request has not been made within the 15 second time limit, \\\\nthey shall decline the request for a Player Review. \\\\n3.2.3 The captain may consult with the bowler and other fielders, and the two batters may consult with each other \\\\nprior to deciding whether to request a Player Review. Either the captain or the two batters may, in respect of \\\\na decision relating to an appeal for LBW, question the bowler’s end umpire as to whether his/her decision \\\\nhas been made on the basis that the striker made no genuine attempt to play the ball with the bat. Under no \\\\nother circumstances is any player permitted to query an umpire about any aspect of a decision before \\\\ndeciding on whether or not to request a Player Review. If the on-field umpires believe that the captain or \\\\neither batter has received direct or indirect input emanating other than from the players on the field, then \\\\nthey may at their discretion decline the request for a Player Review. In particular, signals from the dressing \\\\nroom must not be given. \\\\n3.2.4 No replays, either at normal speed or slow motion, shall be shown on a big screen to spectators until the 15 \\\\nsecond time limit allowed for requesting a Player Review has elapsed.  \\\\n3.2.5 Where either on-field umpire initiates an Umpire Review, this does not preclude a player seeking a Player \\\\nReview of a separate incident from the same delivery. The request for a Player Review may be made after \\\\nthe Umpire Review, provided the request is still within the 15 second time limit described in paragraph 3.2.2 \\\\nabove. (See paragraphs 3.9.2 and 3.9.3 below for the process for addressing both an Umpire and Player \\\\nReview). \\\\n3.2.6 A request for a Player Review cannot be withdrawn once it has been made. \\\\n3.3 The process of consultation \\\\n3.3.1 On receipt of an eligible and timely request for a Player Review, the relevant on-field umpire shall make the \\\\nsign of a shape of a TV screen with his/her hands in the normal way. \\\\n3.3.2 The relevant on-field umpire shall initiate communication with the third umpire by confirming; \\\\n3.3.2.1 That a Player Review has been requested, \\\\n3.3.2.2 The mode of dismissal for which the relevant on-field umpire adjudicated the appeal, \\\\n3.3.2.3 The decision that has been made (Out or Not out), and; \\\\n3.3.2.4 For LBW appeals, where relevant, if the bowler’s end umpire believed that the striker made no \\\\ngenuine attempt to play the ball with the bat (the default presumption of the third umpire in the \\\\nabsence of any information on this point from the bowler’s end umpire shall be that a genuine \\\\nattempt to play the ball with the bat was made). \\\\n3.3.3 A two-way consultation process shall begin to investigate whether there is anything that the third umpire can \\\\nsee or hear which would indicate that the on-field umpire should change his/her original decision. \\\\n3.3.4 The third umpire shall not withhold any factual information which may help in the decision making process. \\\\nIn particular, in reviewing a dismissal, if the third umpire believes that the batter may instead be Out by any \\\\nother mode of dismissal, he/she shall advise the on-field umpire accordingly. The process of consultation \\\\n86 \\\\ndescribed in this paragraph in respect of such other mode of dismissal shall then be conducted as if the \\\\nbatter has been given Not out. \\\\n3.3.5 The third umpire shall initially check all modes of No ball except for the bowler using an Illegal Bowling \\\\nAction (subject to the proviso that the third umpire may review whether the bowler has used a prohibited \\\\nSpecific Variation under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations), where appropriate advising the on-\\\\nfield umpire accordingly. \\\\n3.3.6 If despite the available technology, the third umpire is unable to decide with a high degree of confidence \\\\nwhether the original on-field decision should be changed, then he/she shall report that the replays are \\\\n‘inconclusive’, and that the on-field decision shall stand. The third umpire shall not give answers conveying \\\\nlikelihoods or probabilities. \\\\n3.3.7 In circumstances where the television technology (all or parts thereof) is not available to the third umpire or \\\\nfails for whatever reason, the third umpire shall advise the on-field umpire of this fact but still provide any \\\\nrelevant factual information that may be ascertained from the available television replays and other \\\\ntechnology. \\\\n3.3.8 The on-field umpire shall then make his/her decision based on the information provided by the third umpire, \\\\nany other factual information offered by the third umpire and his/her recollection and opinion of the original \\\\nincident. \\\\n3.3.9 The on-field umpire shall reverse his/her decision if the nature of the supplementary information received \\\\nfrom the third umpire leads him/her to conclude that his/her original decision was incorrect. \\\\n3.4 Review of LBW Decisions \\\\n3.4.1 In assessing whether a batter is Out LBW in accordance with clause 36, the third umpire shall first judge \\\\nwhether the delivery is fair (as set out in clause 36.1.1), and second, whether or not the ball has touched the \\\\nbat before being intercepted by any part of the striker’s person (as set out in clause 36.1.3). \\\\n3.4.2 If the batter is still eligible to be Out, the ball-tracking technology shall then present three pieces of \\\\ninformation to the third umpire relating to the path of the ball: \\\\n3.4.2.1 The point of pitching (where applicable) (PITCHING) \\\\n3.4.2.2 The position of the ball at the point of first interception (IMPACT) \\\\n3.4.2.3 Whether the ball would have hit the wicket (WICKET) \\\\n3.4.3 This Decision Review System (DRS) and Third Umpire Protocol includes a category of Umpire’s Call, which \\\\nshall be the conclusion reported where the technology indicates a marginal decision in respect of either the \\\\npoint of first interception or whether the ball would have hit the stumps. \\\\n3.4.4 PITCHING \\\\n3.4.4.1 The interpretation of “pitches in line between wicket and wicket” in clause 36.1.2 shall refer to the \\\\nposition of the centre of the ball at the point of pitching, in relation to the Pitching Zone. \\\\n3.4.4.2 The Pitching Zone is defined as a two dimensional area on the pitch between both sets of stumps \\\\nwith its boundaries consisting of the base of both sets of stumps and a line between the outside of \\\\nthe outer stumps at each end. \\\\n3.4.4.3 Where applicable, the ball-tracking technology shall report that the ball pitched in one of the \\\\nfollowing three areas in relation to the Pitching Zone: \\\\nIn Line The centre of the ball was inside the Pitching Zone \\\\nOutside Off The centre of the ball was outside, and to the off side of, the Pitching Zone \\\\nOutside Leg The centre of the ball was outside, and to the leg side of, the Pitching \\\\nZone \\\\n \\\\n87 \\\\n3.4.4.4 Subject to the satisfaction of the other elements of clause 36, the batter can be Out if the ball-\\\\ntracking technology reports that the ball pitched Outside Off or In Line, but the batter shall be Not \\\\nout if the ball pitched Outside Leg. \\\\n3.4.5 IMPACT \\\\n3.4.5.1 The interpretation of “the (first) point of impact, even if in above the level of the bails, is between \\\\nwicket and wicket” in clause 36.1.4 shall refer to the position of the ball at the point of first \\\\ninterception, in relation to the Impact Zone. \\\\n3.4.5.2 The Impact Zone is defined as a three dimensional space extending between both wickets to an \\\\nindefinite height and with its boundaries consisting of a line between the outside of the outer \\\\nstumps at each end. \\\\n3.4.5.3 The ball-tracking technology shall report that the point of first interception was in one of the \\\\nfollowing categories in relation to the Impact Zone: \\\\nIn Line The centre of the ball was inside the Impact Zone \\\\nUmpire’s Call Some part of the ball was inside the Impact Zone, but the centre of the ball \\\\nwas outside the Impact Zone, with the further sub-category of ‘Umpire’s Call \\\\n(off side)’ where the centre of the ball was to the off side of the Impact Zone \\\\nand the bowler’s end umpire communicates to the third umpire that no \\\\ngenuine attempt to play the ball was made by the batter. \\\\nOutside No part of the ball was inside the Impact Zone, with the further sub-\\\\ncategories of ‘Outside (off)’ and ‘Outside (leg)’ to indicate the location of the \\\\npoint of first interception in relation to the Impact Zone when the bowler’s \\\\nend umpire communicates to the third umpire that no genuine attempt to \\\\nplay the ball was made by the batter. \\\\n \\\\n3.4.5.4 Where a Not out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batter has made a genuine \\\\nattempt to play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of first interception \\\\nwas In Line for the batter to be eligible to be given Out, otherwise the batter shall remain Not out. \\\\n3.4.5.5 Where a Not out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batter has made no genuine \\\\nattempt to play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of impact was In \\\\nLine, or Umpire’s Call (off side), or Outside (off) for the batter to be eligible to be given Out, \\\\notherwise the batter shall remain Not out. \\\\n3.4.5.6 Where an Out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batter has made a genuine \\\\nattempt to play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of first interception \\\\nwas Outside for the decision to be reversed to Not out, otherwise the batter shall remain eligible to \\\\nbe given Out. \\\\n3.4.5.7 Where an Out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batter has made no genuine \\\\nattempt to play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of first interception \\\\nwas Outside (leg) for the decision to be reversed to Not out, otherwise the batter shall remain \\\\neligible to be given Out. \\\\n3.4.6 WICKET \\\\n3.4.6.1 The interpretation of whether “the ball would have hit the wicket” in clause 36.1.5 shall refer to \\\\nposition of the ball as it either hits or passes the wicket, in relation to the Wicket Zone. \\\\n3.4.6.2 The Wicket Zone is defined as a two dimensional area whose boundaries are the outside of the \\\\nouter stumps, the base of the stumps and the top of the stumps. \\\\n3.4.6.3 The ball-tracking technology shall report whether the ball would have hit the wicket with reference \\\\nto the following three categories: \\\\n88 \\\\nHitting The ball was hitting the wicket, and the centre of the ball was inside the \\\\nWicket Zone \\\\nUmpire’s Call The ball was hitting the wicket, but the centre of the ball was not inside \\\\nthe Wicket Zone \\\\nMissing The ball was missing the wicket \\\\n \\\\n3.4.6.4 Where a Not out decision is being reviewed, the ball-tracking technology must report that the ball \\\\nwas Hitting for the batter to be eligible to be given Out, otherwise the batter shall remain Not out. \\\\nHowever, where the evidence shows that the ball was Hitting, the point of first interception was In \\\\nLine, and the ball pitched In Line or Outside Off, but that: \\\\n• The point of first interception was 300cm or more from the stumps; or \\\\n• The point of first interception was more than 250cm but less than 300cm from the stumps \\\\nand the distance between the point of pitching and the point of first interception was less \\\\nthan 40cm, \\\\nthe on-field decision shall stand (that is, Not out). \\\\n3.4.6.5 Where an Out decision is being reviewed, the ball-tracking technology must report that the ball was \\\\nMissing for the on-field decision to be reversed to Not out, otherwise the batter shall remain eligible \\\\nto be given Out. \\\\n3.4.7 When the ball strikes the batter on the full, and the evidence provided by the ball-tracking technology \\\\nindicates that the ball would have pitched before striking or passing the wicket, there will be no information \\\\navailable from that delivery that will allow the ball-tracking technology to accurately predict the height of the \\\\nball after pitching. \\\\n3.4.8 With regard to determining whether the ball would have hit the wicket under these circumstances, the ball-\\\\ntracking technology shall project the line of the ball in accordance with clause 36.2.3 (it is to be assumed \\\\nthat the path of the ball before interception would have continued after interception, irrespective of whether \\\\nthe ball might have pitched subsequently or not), and display the simulated path of the ball from directly \\\\nabove the wicket. \\\\n3.4.9 The third umpire shall advise the bowler’s end umpire only on the point of first interception and whether the \\\\nball would have hit the stumps (in line with the process set out in paragraph 3.4 above), but shall make no \\\\ncomment on the predicted height of the ball after pitching, which shall remain a judgment of the bowler’s end \\\\numpire. \\\\n3.5 The process for communicating the final decision \\\\n3.5.1 For Player Reviews concerning potential dismissals, the relevant on-field umpire shall indicate Out by raising \\\\nhis/her finger above his/her head in a normal yet prominent manner or indicate Not out by the call of ‘not out’ \\\\nand by crossing his/her hands in a horizontal position side to side in front and above his/her waist three \\\\ntimes. Where the decision is a reversal of the on-field umpire’s previous decision, he/she shall make the \\\\n‘revoke last signal’ indication immediately prior to the above. \\\\n3.5.2 If the mode of dismissal is not obvious or not the same as that on which the original decision was based, \\\\nthen the umpire shall advise the scorers via the third umpire. \\\\n3.6 Number of Player Review requests permitted \\\\n3.6.1 In each innings, each team shall be allowed to make a maximum of three Player Review requests that are \\\\ncategorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ (as set out in paragraph 3.6.3 below). \\\\n3.6.2 Where a request for a Player Review results in the original on-field decision being reversed, then the Player \\\\nReview shall be categorised as ‘Successful’ and shall not count towards the innings limit. \\\\n89 \\\\n3.6.3 Where a request for a Player Review results in the original on-field decision remaining unchanged (other \\\\nthan in the circumstances set out in paragraphs 3.6.4, 3.6.6 or 3.6.8), the Player Review shall be \\\\ncategorised as ’Unsuccessful’. \\\\n3.6.4 Where a request for a Player Review of an LBW decision results in the on-field decision remaining \\\\nunchanged solely on the basis of an Umpire’s Call, the Player Review shall be categorised as ‘Unchanged - \\\\nUmpire’s Call’. A Player Review categorised as ‘Unchanged - Umpire’s Call’ shall not count towards the \\\\ninnings limit set out in paragraph 3.6.1. \\\\n3.6.5 Where, following a request for a Player Review, the original on-field decision of Out is unchanged, but for a \\\\ndifferent mode of dismissal from the original on-field decision, then the Player Review shall still be \\\\ncategorised as ’Unsuccessful’. \\\\n3.6.6 Where, following a request for a Player Review, the original on-field decision of Not out is unchanged on \\\\naccount of the delivery being a No ball (for any reason), thereby not requiring any further evaluation, the \\\\nPlayer Review shall not be counted as ‘Unsuccessful’ and accordingly shall not count towards the innings \\\\nlimit set out in paragraph 3.6.1. \\\\n3.6.7 Where a Player Review and an Umpire Review are requested from the same delivery and the decision of \\\\nthe third umpire from the Umpire Review renders the Player Review unnecessary (see paragraphs 3.9.2 and \\\\n3.9.3), the Player Review request shall be disregarded and accordingly shall not count towards the innings \\\\nlimit set out in paragraph 3.6.1. \\\\n3.6.8 A Player Review categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ may be reinstated by the ICC Match Referee at his/her sole \\\\ndiscretion (if appropriate after consultation with the ICC Technical Official and/or the television broadcast \\\\ndirector) if the Player Review could not properly be concluded due to a failure of the technology. Any such \\\\ndecision shall be final and shall be taken as soon as possible, being communicated to both teams once all \\\\nthe relevant facts have been ascertained by the ICC Match Referee. A Player Review categorised as \\\\n‘Unsuccessful’ shall not be reinstated if, despite any technical failures, the correct decision could still have \\\\nbeen made using the other available technology. Similarly, a Player Review categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ \\\\nshall not be reinstated where the technology worked as intended, but the evidence gleaned from its use was \\\\ninconclusive. \\\\n3.6.9 The third umpire shall be responsible for counting the number Player Reviews categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ \\\\nand shall advise the on-field umpires once either team has exhausted their allowance for the innings. \\\\n3.6.10 The scoreboard shall display, for the innings in progress, the number of Player Reviews remaining available \\\\nto each team. \\\\nCategory of Player Review Outcome of Player Review  Consequence of Player Review \\\\nSuccessful (paragraph 3.6.2) On-field decision reversed  Does not count towards innings \\\\nlimit set out in paragraph 3.6.1 \\\\nUnsuccessful (paragraphs 3.6.3 \\\\nand 3.6.5) \\\\nOn-field decision unchanged Counts towards innings limit set \\\\nout in paragraph 3.6.1 \\\\nUnchanged - Umpire’s Call \\\\n(paragraph 3.6.4) \\\\nOn-field decision unchanged Does not count towards innings \\\\nlimit set out in paragraph 3.6.1 \\\\nNo ball - no evaluation required \\\\n(paragraph 3.6.6) \\\\nOn-field decision unchanged Does not count towards innings \\\\nlimit set out in paragraph 3.6.1 \\\\nFailure of technology (paragraph \\\\n3.6.8) \\\\nOn-field decision unchanged Does not count towards innings \\\\nlimit set out in paragraph 3.6.1 \\\\n \\\\n3.7 Dead ball \\\\n3.7.1 If following a Player Review request, an original decision of Out is changed to Not out, then the ball is still \\\\ndeemed to have become dead when the original decision was made (as per clause 20.1.1.3). The batting \\\\nside, while benefiting from the reversal of the dismissal, shall not benefit from any runs that may \\\\n90 \\\\nsubsequently have accrued from the delivery had the on-field umpire originally made a Not out decision, \\\\nother than any No ball penalty that could arise under paragraph 3.3.5 above. \\\\n3.7.2 If an original decision of Not out is changed to Out, the ball shall retrospectively be deemed to have become \\\\ndead from the moment of the dismissal event. All subsequent events, including any runs scored, shall be \\\\nignored. \\\\n3.8 Use of technology \\\\n3.8.1 The following technology may be used by the third umpire during a Player Review: \\\\n3.8.1.1 Replays, at any speed, from any available broadcast camera \\\\n3.8.1.2 Sound from the stump microphones with the replays at normal speed and slow motion \\\\n3.8.1.3 Approved ball-tracking technology:  \\\\n• HawkEye (HawkEye Innovations), or; \\\\n• VirtualEye (ARL) \\\\n3.8.1.4 Approved sound-based edge detection technology: \\\\n• Real-Time Snickometer (BBG Sports), or; \\\\n• UltraEdge (HawkEye Innovations) \\\\n3.8.1.5 Approved heat-based edge detection technology: \\\\n• Hot Spot cameras (BBG Sports) \\\\n3.8.1.6 LED Wickets (using the lights to indicate if the wicket is broken, as set out in paragraph 4.2): \\\\n• Zing Bails and Stumps \\\\n3.8.2 In addition, other forms of technology may be used subject to the ICC being satisfied that the required \\\\nstandards of accuracy and time efficiency can be met. \\\\n3.8.3 Where practical usage or further testing indicates that any of the above forms of technology cannot reliably \\\\nprovide accurate and timely information, then it may be removed prior to or during a match. The final \\\\ndecision regarding the technology to be used in a given match shall be taken by the ICC Match Referee in \\\\nconsultation with the ICC Technical Official, ICC management and the competing teams’ governing bodies. \\\\n3.9 Combining Umpire Review with Player Review \\\\n3.9.1 If an Umpire Review (under paragraph 2) and a request for a Player Review (under paragraph 3) are made \\\\nfollowing the same delivery but relating to separate modes of dismissal, the following process shall apply. \\\\n3.9.2 The Umpire Review shall be carried out prior to the Player Review if all of the following conditions apply: \\\\n3.9.2.1 The Player Review has been requested by the fielding side \\\\n3.9.2.2 The Umpire Review and the Player Review both relate to the dismissal of the same batter \\\\n3.9.2.3 If the batter is out, the number of runs scored from the delivery would be the same for both modes \\\\nof dismissal \\\\n3.9.2.4 If the batter is out, the batter on strike for the next delivery would be the same for both modes of \\\\ndismissal. \\\\n3.9.3 If the Umpire Review leads the third umpire to make a decision of Out, then this shall be displayed in the \\\\nusual manner and the Player Review shall not be undertaken. If the Umpire Review results in a Not out \\\\ndecision, then the third umpire shall make no public decision but shall proceed to address the request for a \\\\nPlayer Review. \\\\n3.9.4 For illustration, following an LBW appeal which is given Not out by the bowler’s end umpire, the striker sets \\\\noff for a run, is sent back and there is an appeal for her run out. The players request that the LBW decision \\\\n91 \\\\nis reviewed and the umpires request that the run out be reviewed. The four criteria above are satisfied, so \\\\nthe run out referral is determined first. Should the appeal for run out be Out, then there is no requirement for \\\\nthe LBW review to take place. \\\\n3.9.5 In all other circumstances, the incidents shall be addressed in chronological order. If the conclusion from the \\\\nfirst incident is that a batter is dismissed, then the ball would be deemed to have become dead at that point, \\\\nrendering investigation of the second incident unnecessary. \\\\n4 Interpretation of Playing Conditions \\\\n4.1 When using a replay to determine the moment at which the wicket has been broken (as per clause 29.1), the \\\\nthird umpire shall deem this to be the first frame in which one of the bails is shown (or can be deduced) to \\\\nhave lost all contact with the top of the stumps and subsequent frames show the bail permanently removed \\\\nfrom the top of the stumps. \\\\n4.2 Where LED Wickets are used (as provided for in paragraph 3.8.1.6) the moment at which the wicket has been \\\\nbroken (as per clause 29.1) shall be deemed to be the first frame in which the LED lights are illuminated and \\\\nsubsequent frames show the bail permanently removed from the top of the stumps. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n92 \\\\nAppendix E  \\\\n \\\\nCalculations  \\\\nCalculation Template for Last Day of Test Match  \\\\nThis template applies to any interruption on the last day which causes a loss in actual playing time, (i.e. an \\\\ninterruption longer than the amount of extra time available) and where play resumes after the scheduled tea interval.   \\\\nWhere play resumes prior to tea, then the calculation of overs remaining in the day is performed as per Days 1-3, \\\\nwith the scheduled time for the last hour affected only by the adding of any extra time. Lines A, B, C, D and E should \\\\nbe completed at the start of an interruption on the final day.  \\\\nIf play resumes without any lost playing time, or prior to the tea interval, then this sheet can be discarded.  \\\\nOnce the length of interruption exceeds D and actual playing time is lost, then line F can be completed Lines G and H \\\\ncan be completed immediately if the interruption starts after tea, otherwise as soon as the interruption includes the \\\\ntea interval.   \\\\nA Start of interruption  ___________ \\\\nB Minimum overs remaining before start of last hour as at time A  ___________  \\\\n(see Note 1) \\\\nC Time required to bowl minimum overs @ 3.52 mins per over (B x 3.52)  \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n___________ \\\\nD Extra time available as at time A  ___________ \\\\nE Scheduled time for last hour as at time A  ___________ \\\\nF Rescheduled time for last hour (Time basis) (D + E)  ___________ \\\\nG Length of intervals covered by interruption:                   \\\\nenter 40 (lunch), 20 (tea), 60 (both) or 0 (neither) \\\\n___________ \\\\nH Rescheduled time for last hour (Overs basis) (A + C + D + G)  ___________ \\\\nI Later of F and H above ___________ \\\\nJ Time play resumes  ___________ \\\\nCase A:  If J is earlier than I, play resumes prior to the last hour     \\\\nK Minutes playing time lost ( J - A - D - G ) ___________ \\\\n93 \\\\nL Overs lost @ 3.52 mins per over (see Note 2)  \\\\nM Minimum overs before start of last hour (B - L) (See Note 1)  \\\\nThe last hour then starts at the later of the time in Line F and \\\\nthe completion of the overs in Line M  \\\\n \\\\n___________ \\\\nCase B: If J is not earlier than I, play resumes in the last hour \\\\nK Time for last hour to finish (I plus 60 minutes)  ___________ \\\\nL Minutes remaining in last hour (K - J) ___________ \\\\nM Overs remaining in last hour (L / 3.52 mins or part thereof) \\\\n(see Note 1) \\\\n___________  \\\\n \\\\nNote 1: If an interruption occurs part-way through an over, in Row B enter the number of full overs remaining, ignoring \\\\nthe part over. Then in Row M, add back the part over to the minimum overs to be bowled on resumption.  \\\\nNote 2: The actual overs lost for a given interruption will also reflect any earlier interruptions in the day, so that one \\\\nover is lost in the day for each full 3.52 minutes of aggregated playing time lost. For example, 10 minutes loses 2 \\\\novers, but another 10 minute delay loses 5 overs. \\\\n \\\\nAppendix F \\\\nUse of Electronic Communications Equipment \\\\nThe use of electronic communication devices and equipment of any kind to communicate with players on the field of \\\\nplay shall not be permitted. \\\\n \\\\nAppendix G \\\\nOn Field Injury Assessments and Treatment \\\\nThe umpires will allow an initial 4 minutes for medical staff to treat the injured player. Umpires may inform the medical \\\\nteam when there is 90 seconds remaining, after which, the player should be removed from the field of play if further \\\\nassessment/treatment is required. The on-field umpires will consider each incident when applying the 4-minute \\\\nguideline and be guided by the appointed Match Day Doctor or his/her nominated replacement. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\"}{\\'filename\\': \\'fileh.txt\\', \\'text\\': \\'https://howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Players/PlayerList.asp?Country=ALL&Group=A\\\\nhttps://www.sportmember.co.uk/en/sports-rules/cricket-rules-and-laws\\\\nhttps://blog.cricheroes.com/cricket-rules-and-regulations/\\'}{\\'filename\\': \\'men_2025.pdf\\', \\'text\\': \" \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nICC CHAMPIONS TROPHY 2025 PLAYING CONDITIONS\\\\n \\\\n1 \\\\nPreamble - The Spirit of Cricket \\\\nCricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only according to the Laws  \\\\n(which are incorporated within these Playing Conditions), but also within the Spirit of Cricket.  \\\\nThe major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains, but extends to all players, match officials and, \\\\nespecially in junior cricket, teachers, coaches and parents. \\\\nRespect is central to the Spirit of Cricket. \\\\nRespect your captain, team-mates, opponents and the authority of the umpires. \\\\nPlay hard and play fair. \\\\nAccept the umpire’s decision. \\\\nCreate a positive atmosphere by your own conduct, and encourage others to do likewise. \\\\nShow self-discipline, even when things go against you. \\\\nCongratulate the opposition on their successes, and enjoy those of your own team. \\\\nThank the officials and your opposition at the end of the match, whatever the result. \\\\nCricket is an exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship and teamwork, which brings together people from \\\\ndifferent nationalities, cultures and religions, especially when played within the Spirit of Cricket. \\\\n1 THE PLAYERS \\\\n1.1 Number of players \\\\nA match is played between two sides, each of eleven players, one of whom shall be captain. \\\\n1.2 Nomination and replacement of players \\\\n1.2.1 Each captain shall nominate 11 players plus a maximum of 4 substitute fielders in writing  on the team sheet \\\\nprovided by the ICC.  Other than set out in clause 1.2.7, no player (member of the playing eleven) may be \\\\nchanged after the nomination and prior to the start of play without the consent of the opposing captain. \\\\n1.2.2 Immediately prior to the toss, the ICC Match Referee or their nominee shall check with both team captains \\\\nthat the players nominated on the team sheets are correct. \\\\n1.2.3 Only those nominated as substitute fielders (see also clause 1.2.2 above) shall be entitled to act as \\\\nsubstitute fielders during the match, unless the ICC Match Referee, in exceptional circumstances, allows \\\\nsubsequent additions. \\\\n1.2.4 All those nominated including those nominated as substitute fielders, as well as any Concussion \\\\nReplacements, must be  official squad members of that particular team and by such nomination the \\\\nnominees shall warrant that they are so eligible. \\\\n1.2.5 In addition, by their nomination, the nominees shall be deemed to have agreed to abide by all the applicable \\\\nICC Regulations pertaining to international cricket and in particular, the Clothing and Equipment \\\\nRegulations, the Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel (hereafter referred to as the \\\\nICC Code of Conduct), the Anti- Discrimination Code for Players and Player Support Personnel, the Anti-\\\\nDoping Code and the Anti-Corruption Code. \\\\n1.2.6 A player or player support personnel who has been suspended from participating in a match shall not, from \\\\nthe toss of the coin and for the remainder of the match thereafter: \\\\n1.2.6.1 Be nominated as, or carry out any of the duties or responsibilities of a substitute fielder, or \\\\n \\\\n2 \\\\n1.2.6.2 Enter any part of the playing area (which shall include the field of play and the area between the \\\\nboundary and the perimeter boards) at any time, including any scheduled or unscheduled breaks in \\\\nplay. \\\\n1.2.7 A player who has been suspended from participating in a match shall be permitted from the toss of the coin \\\\nand for the remainder of the match thereafter be permitted to enter the players’ dressing room provided that \\\\nthe players’ dressing room (or any part thereof) for the match is not within the playing area described in \\\\nclause 1.2.6.2 above (for example, the player is not permitted to enter the on-field ‘dug-out’). \\\\n1.2.7 Concussion Replacement \\\\n1.2.7.1 If a player sustains a concussion or suspected concussion as a result of a head or neck injury during the \\\\ncourse of the relevant match, a Concussion Replacement may be permitted in the following circumstances: \\\\n1.2.7.1.1 the head or neck injury must have been sustained during play and within the playing area \\\\ndescribed in clause 1.2.5.2 above; \\\\n1.2.7.1.2 a concussion or suspected concussion must have been formally diagnosed by the Team Medical \\\\nRepresentative; \\\\n1.2.7.1.3 the Team Medical Representative or Team Manager shall submit a Concussion Replacement \\\\nRequest to the ICC Match Referee on a standard form, which shall: \\\\n1.2.7.1.3.1 identify the player who has sustained the concussion or suspected concussion;  \\\\n1.2.7.1.3.2 specify the incident in which the concussion or suspected concussion was \\\\nsustained, including the time at which it occurred; \\\\n1.2.7.1.3.3 confirm that, following an examination, the Team Medical Representative believes \\\\nor suspects that the player has sustained a concussion as a result of the incident \\\\nspecified in clause 1.2.7.1.3.2 above; and  \\\\n1.2.7.1.3.4 identify the requested Concussion Replacement, who shall be a like-for-like \\\\nreplacement for the player who has sustained the concussion or suspected \\\\nconcussion. \\\\n1.2.7.2 The Concussion Replacement Request must be submitted as soon as possible after the incident specified in \\\\nclause 1.2.7.1.3.2 if a Concussion Replacement is to be permitted. \\\\n1.2.7.3 The ICC Match Referee should ordinarily approve a Concussion Replacement Request if the replacement is \\\\na like-for-like player whose inclusion will not excessively advantage his team for the remainder of the match. \\\\n1.2.7.4 In assessing whether the nominated Concussion Replacement should be considered a like-for-like player, \\\\nthe ICC Match Referee should consider the likely role the concussed player would have played during the \\\\nremainder of the match, and the normal role that would be performed by the nominated Concussion \\\\nReplacement. \\\\n1.2.7.5 If the ICC Match Referee believes that the inclusion of the nominated Concussion Replacement, when \\\\nperforming their normal role, would excessively advantage their team, the ICC Match Referee may impose \\\\nsuch conditions upon the identity and involvement of the Concussion Replacement as he/she sees fit, in line \\\\nwith the overriding objective of facilitating a like-for-like replacement for the concussed player. \\\\nFor clarity, a concussion replacement will not be permitted to bowl during the innings and/or for the \\\\nremainder of the match if the replaced player was suspended from bowling for any reason at the time they \\\\nwere replaced. \\\\n1.2.7.6 The ICC Match Referee may, in reviewing a Concussion Replacement Request made in accordance with \\\\nclause 1.2.7.1.3, request any such further information as may be required in order to make the determination \\\\nrequired under clauses 1.2.7.4 and 1.2.7.5. \\\\n1.2.7.7 The decision of the ICC Match Referee in relation to any Concussion Replacement Request shall be final \\\\nand neither team shall have any right of appeal. \\\\n \\\\n3 \\\\n1.2.7.8 Once the Concussion Replacement has been approved by the ICC Match Referee, the replaced player shall \\\\nplay no further part in the match. \\\\n1.2.7.9 Both the Concussion Replacement and the replaced player shall be considered to have played in the match \\\\nfor records and statistical purposes. \\\\n \\\\n1.3 Captain \\\\n1.3.1 If at any time the captain is not available, a deputy shall act for him. \\\\n1.3.2 If a captain is not available to nominate the players, then any person associated with that team may act as \\\\nhis deputy to do so. See clause1.2. \\\\n1.3.3 At any time after the nomination of the players, only a nominated player can act as deputy in discharging the \\\\nduties and responsibilities of the captain as stated in these Playing Conditions, including at the toss. See \\\\nclause 13.4 (The toss). \\\\n1.4 Responsibility of captains \\\\nThe captains are responsible at all times for ensuring that play is conducted within The Spirit of Cricket as well as \\\\nwithin these Playing Conditions. \\\\n2 THE UMPIRES \\\\n2.1 Appointment and attendance \\\\n \\\\n2.1.1 The umpires shall control the game as required by these Playing Conditions, with absolute impartiality and \\\\nshall be present at the ground at least 1.5 hours before the scheduled start of play. \\\\n2.1.2       ICC shall appoint the on-field umpires, third umpire and fourth umpire for all matches. The fourth umpire \\\\nshall act as the emergency on-field umpire.  \\\\n2.1.3      The umpires shall not be from the same country as the participating teams and shall be selected from the \\\\nICC ‘Elite Panel’ or the ICC ‘International Panel’. In exceptional circumstances, the third or fourth umpire \\\\nmay be from the same country as one of the participating teams. \\\\n2.1.4      The ICC shall appoint the match referee for all matches (ICC Match Referee).  \\\\n2.1.5      Unless exceptional circumstances arise, the match referee shall not be from the same country as the \\\\nparticipating teams.  \\\\n2.1.6      Neither team shall have a right of objection to the appointment of any umpire or match referee. \\\\n2.2 Change of umpire \\\\nAn umpire shall not be changed during the match, other than in exceptional circumstances, unless he/she is injured \\\\nor ill. \\\\n2.3 Consultation with  Ground Authority \\\\nBefore the match the umpires shall consult with the  Ground Authority to determine; \\\\n2.3.1 which clock or watch and back-up time piece is to be used during the match. \\\\n2.3.2 the boundary of the field of play. See clause 19 (Boundaries). \\\\n2.3.3 the use of covers. See clause 10 (Covering the pitch). \\\\n2.3.4 any special conditions of play affecting the conduct of the match. \\\\n \\\\n4 \\\\ninform the scorers of agreements in  2.3.1 and 2.3.2. \\\\n2.4 The wickets, creases and boundaries \\\\nBefore the toss and during the match, the umpires shall satisfy themselves that \\\\n2.4.1 the creases are correctly marked. See clause 7 (The creases). \\\\n2.4.2 the wickets are properly pitched. See clause 8 (The wickets) \\\\n2.4.3 the boundary of the field of play complies with the requirements of clauses 19.1 (Determining the boundary \\\\nof the field of play), 19.2 (Identifying and marking the boundary) and 19.3 (Restoring the boundary). \\\\n2.5 Conduct of the match, implements and equipment \\\\nBefore the toss and during the match, the umpires shall satisfy themselves that \\\\n2.5.1 the conduct of the match is strictly in accordance with these Playing Conditions. \\\\n2.5.2 the implements used in the match conform to the following \\\\n2.5.2.1 clause 4 (The ball). \\\\n2.5.2.2 externally visible requirements of clause 5 (The bat) and paragraph 1 of Appendix B \\\\n2.5.2.3 either clauses 8.2 (Size of stumps) and 8.3 (The bails). \\\\n2.5.3 no player uses equipment other than that permitted. See paragraph 2 of Appendix A. Note particularly \\\\ntherein the interpretation of ‘protective helmet’. \\\\n2.5.4 the wicket-keeper’s gloves comply with the requirements of clause 27.2 (Gloves). \\\\n2.6 Fair and unfair play \\\\nThe umpires shall be the sole judges of fair and unfair play. \\\\n2.7 Fitness for play \\\\n2.7.1 It is solely for the umpires together to decide whether either conditions of ground, weather or light or \\\\nexceptional circumstances mean that it would be dangerous or unreasonable for play to take place. \\\\nConditions shall not be regarded as either dangerous or unreasonable merely because they are not ideal. \\\\nThe fact that the grass and the ball are wet does not warrant the ground conditions being regarded as \\\\nunreasonable or dangerous. \\\\n2.7.2 Conditions shall be regarded as dangerous if there is actual and foreseeable risk to the safety of any player \\\\nor umpire. \\\\n2.7.3 Conditions shall be regarded as unreasonable if, although posing no risk to safety, it would not be sensible \\\\nfor play to proceed. \\\\n2.7.4 If the umpires consider the ground is so wet or slippery as to deprive the bowler of a reasonable foothold, \\\\nthe fielders of the power of free movement, or the batters of the ability to play their strokes or to run between \\\\nthe wickets, then these conditions shall be regarded as so bad that it would be dangerous and unreasonable \\\\nfor play to take place. \\\\n2.8 Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable \\\\ncircumstances \\\\n2.8.1 All references to ground include the pitch. See clause 6.1 (Area of pitch). \\\\n2.8.2 If at any time the umpires together agree that the conditions of ground, weather or light, or any other \\\\ncircumstances are dangerous or unreasonable, they shall immediately suspend play, or not allow play to \\\\n \\\\n5 \\\\nstart or to recommence. The decision as to whether conditions are so bad as to warrant such action is one \\\\nfor the umpires alone to make, following consultation with the ICC Match Referee. \\\\n2.8.3 If circumstances are warranted, the umpires shall stop play and instruct the Ground Authority to take \\\\nwhatever action they can and use whatever equipment is necessary to remove as much dew as possible \\\\nfrom the outfield when conditions become unreasonable or dangerous. The umpires may also instruct the \\\\nground staff to take such action during scheduled and unscheduled breaks in play. \\\\n2.8.4 The umpires shall disregard any shadow on the pitch from the stadium or from any permanent object on the \\\\nground. \\\\n2.8.5 Light Meters \\\\nIt is the responsibility of the ICC to supply light meters to the match officials to be used in accordance with \\\\nthese playing conditions. \\\\n2.8.5.1 All light meters shall be uniformly calibrated. \\\\n2.8.5.2 The umpires shall be entitled to use light meter readings as a guideline for determining whether the \\\\nlight is fit for play in accordance with the criteria set out in clause 2.8.2 above. \\\\n2.8.5.3 Light meter readings may accordingly be used by the umpires: \\\\n2.8.5.3.1 To determine whether there has been at any stage a deterioration or improvement in the light. \\\\n2.8.5.3.2 As benchmarks for the remainder of a match. \\\\n2.8.6 Use of artificial lights \\\\nIf in the opinion of the umpires, natural light is deteriorating to an unfit level, they shall authorize the Ground \\\\nAuthority to use the available artificial lighting so that the match can commence or continue in acceptable \\\\nconditions. \\\\nIn the event of power failure or lights malfunction, the provisions relating to the delay or interruption of play \\\\ndue to bad weather or light shall apply. \\\\n2.8.7 When there is a suspension of play it is the responsibility of the umpires to monitor conditions. They shall \\\\nmake inspections as often as appropriate, unaccompanied by any players or officials. Immediately the \\\\numpires together agree that the conditions are no longer dangerous or unreasonable they shall call upon the \\\\nplayers to resume play. \\\\n2.8.8 The safety of all persons within the ground is of paramount importance to the ICC. In the event that of any \\\\nthreatening circumstance, whether actual or perceived (including for example weather, pitch invasions, act \\\\nof God, etc.), then the umpires, on the advice of the ICC Match Referee, should suspend play and all \\\\nplayers and officials should immediately be asked to leave the field of play in a safe and orderly manner and \\\\nto relocate to a secure and safe area (depending on each particular threat) pending the satisfactory passing \\\\nor resolution of such threat or risk to the reasonable satisfaction of the umpires, the ICC Match Referee, the \\\\nhead of the relevant Ground Authority, the head of ground security and/or the police as the circumstances \\\\nmay require. \\\\n2.8.9 Where play is suspended under clause 2.8.8 above the decision to abandon or resume play shall be the \\\\nresponsibility of the ICC Match Referee who shall act only after consultation with the head of ground security \\\\nand the police. \\\\n2.9 Position of umpires \\\\nThe umpires shall stand where they can best see any act upon which their decision may be required. \\\\nSubject to this over-riding consideration, the bowler’s end umpire shall stand in a position so as not to interfere with \\\\neither the bowler’s run-up or the striker’s view. \\\\nThe striker’s end umpire may elect to stand on the off side instead of the on side of the pitch, provided he/she informs \\\\nthe captain of the fielding side, the striker and the other umpire. \\\\n \\\\n6 \\\\n2.10 Umpires changing ends \\\\nShall not apply. \\\\n2.11 Disagreement and dispute \\\\nWhere there is disagreement or dispute about any matter, the umpires together shall make the final decision. See \\\\nalso clause 31.6 (Consultation by umpires). \\\\n2.12 Umpire’s decision \\\\nAn umpire may alter any decision provided that such alteration is made promptly and does not contradict clause 20.6 \\\\n(Dead ball not to be revoked). This apart, an umpire’s decision, once made, is final. \\\\n2.13 Signals \\\\n2.13.1 The following code of signals shall be used by umpires. \\\\n2.13.1.1 Signals made while the ball is in play \\\\nNo ball - by extending one arm horizontally. \\\\nOut - by raising an index finger above the head. (If not out, the umpire shall call Not out.) \\\\nWide - by extending both arms horizontally. \\\\nDead ball - by crossing and re-crossing the wrists below the waist. \\\\n2.13.1.2 When the ball is dead, the bowler’s end umpire shall repeat the signals in clause 2.13.1.1, with the \\\\nexception of the signal for Out, to the scorers. \\\\n2.13.1.3 The signals listed below shall be made to the scorers only when the ball is dead. \\\\nBoundary 4 - by waving an arm from side to side finishing with the arm across the chest \\\\nBoundary 6 - by raising both arms above the head. \\\\nBye - by raising an open hand above the head. \\\\nFive Penalty runs awarded to the batting side - by repeated tapping of one shoulder with the \\\\nopposite hand. \\\\nFive Penalty runs awarded to the fielding side - by placing one hand on the opposite shoulder. \\\\nLeg bye - by touching a raised knee with the hand. \\\\nRevoke last signal - by touching both shoulders, each with the opposite hand. \\\\nShort run - by bending one arm upwards and touching the nearer shoulder with the tips of the \\\\nfingers. \\\\nFree Hit – after signaling the No ball, the bowler’s end umpire extends one arm straight upwards \\\\nand moves it in a circular motion. \\\\nPowerplay Over – by rotating his arm in a large circle. \\\\nThe following signal is for Level 4 player conduct offences. The signal has two parts, both of which should be \\\\nacknowledged separately by the scorers. \\\\nLevel 4 conduct Part 1 - by putting one arm out to the side of the body and repeatedly raising it and \\\\nlowering it. \\\\nPart 2 - by raising an index finger, held at shoulder height, to the side of the body. \\\\n2.13.1.4 All the signals in clause 2.13.1.3 are to be made by the bowler’s end umpire except that for Short \\\\nrun, which is to be signalled by the umpire at the end where short running occurs. However, the \\\\nbowler’s end umpire shall be responsible both for the final signal of Short run to the scorers and, if \\\\nmore than one run is short, for informing them as to the number of runs to be recorded. \\\\n \\\\n7 \\\\n2.13.2 The umpire shall wait until each signal to the scorers has been separately acknowledged by a scorer before \\\\nallowing play to proceed. \\\\nIf several signals are to be used, they should be given in the order that the events occurred. \\\\n2.14 Informing the umpires \\\\nWherever the umpires are to receive information from captains or other players under these Playing Conditions, it will \\\\nbe sufficient for one umpire to be so informed and for him/her to inform the other umpire. \\\\n2.15 Correctness of scores \\\\nConsultation between umpires and scorers on doubtful points is essential. The umpires shall, throughout the match, \\\\nsatisfy themselves as to the correctness of the number of runs scored, the wickets that have fallen and, where \\\\nappropriate, the number of overs bowled. \\\\nThe umpires shall ensure that they are able to contact the scorers at any time during the match and at its conclusion \\\\nto address any issues relating to the correctness of scores. \\\\n3 THE SCORERS \\\\n3.1 Appointment of scorers \\\\nTwo scorers shall be appointed to record all runs scored, all wickets taken and, where appropriate, number of overs \\\\nbowled. \\\\n3.2 Correctness of scores \\\\nThe scorers shall frequently check to ensure that their records agree and consult with the umpires if necessary. See \\\\nclause 2.15 (Correctness of scores). \\\\n3.3 Acknowledging signals \\\\nThe scorers shall accept all instructions and signals given to them by the umpires and shall immediately acknowledge \\\\neach separate signal. \\\\n4 THE BALL \\\\n4.1 Weight and size \\\\nThe ball, when new, shall weigh not less than 5.5 ounces/155.9 g, nor more than 5.75 ounces/163 g, and shall \\\\nmeasure not less than 8.81 in/22.4 cm, nor more than 9 in/22.9 cm in circumference. \\\\n4.2 Approval and control of balls \\\\n4.2.1 White Kookaburra ‘Turf’ cricket balls supplied by ICC will be used in all matches. Spare balls of the same \\\\nbrand will be supplied for changing during a match. \\\\n4.2.2 The fielding captain or his nominee may select the ball with which he wishes to bowl from the supply \\\\nprovided by the  ICC. The fourth umpire shall take a box containing at least 6 new balls to the dressing room \\\\nand supervise the selection of the ball. \\\\n4.2.3 The umpires shall retain possession of the match ball(s) throughout the duration of the match when play is \\\\nnot actually taking place. \\\\n4.2.4 During play umpires shall periodically and irregularly inspect the condition of the ball and shall retain \\\\npossession of it at the fall of a wicket, a drinks interval, or any other disruption in play. \\\\n4.3 New ball \\\\n4.3.1 Each fielding team shall have two new balls for its innings, to be used in alternate overs i.e. one from each \\\\nend. \\\\n \\\\n8 \\\\n4.3.2 In a match reduced to 25 overs or less per side before the first innings commences, each team shall have \\\\nonly one new ball for its Innings. \\\\n4.4 Ball lost or becoming unfit for play \\\\nIf, during play, the ball cannot be found or recovered or the umpires agree that it has become unfit for play through \\\\nnormal use, the umpires shall replace it with a ball which has had wear comparable with that which the previous ball \\\\nhad received before the need for its replacement. When the ball is replaced, the umpire shall inform the batters and \\\\nthe fielding captain. \\\\n5 THE BAT \\\\n5.1 The bat \\\\n5.1.1 The bat consists of two parts, a handle and a blade. \\\\n5.1.2 The basic requirements and measurements of the bat are set out in this clause with detailed specifications in \\\\nparagraph 1 of Appendix B. \\\\n5.2 The handle \\\\n5.2.1 The handle is to be made principally of cane and/or wood. \\\\n5.2.2 The part of the handle that is wholly outside the blade is defined to be the upper portion of the handle. It is a \\\\nstraight shaft for holding the bat. \\\\n5.2.3 The upper portion of the handle may be covered with a grip as defined in paragraph 1.2.2 of Appendix B. \\\\n5.3 The blade \\\\n5.3.1 The blade comprises the whole of the bat apart from the handle as defined in clause 5.2 and in paragraph \\\\n1.3 of Appendix B. \\\\n5.3.2 The blade shall consist solely of wood. \\\\n5.4 Protection and repair \\\\nSubject to the specifications in paragraph 1.4 of Appendix B. and providing clause 5.5 is not contravened, \\\\n5.4.1 solely for the purposes of \\\\neither protection from surface damage to the face, sides and shoulders of the blade \\\\nor repair to the blade after surface damage, \\\\nmaterial that is not rigid, either at the time of its application to the blade or subsequently, may be placed on \\\\nthese surfaces. \\\\n5.4.2 for repair of the blade after damage other than surface damage \\\\n5.4.2.1 solid material may be inserted into the blade. \\\\n5.4.2.2 The only material permitted for any insertion is wood with minimal essential adhesives. \\\\n5.4.3 to prevent damage to the toe, material may be placed on that part of the blade but shall not extend over any \\\\npart of the face, back or sides of the blade. \\\\n5.5 Damage to the ball \\\\n5.5.1 For any part of the bat, covered or uncovered, the hardness of the constituent materials and the surface \\\\ntexture thereof shall not be such that either or both could cause unacceptable damage to the ball. \\\\n5.5.2 Any material placed on any part of the bat, for whatever purpose, shall similarly not be such that it could \\\\ncause unacceptable damage to the ball. \\\\n \\\\n9 \\\\n5.5.3 For the purpose of this clause, unacceptable damage is any change that is greater than normal wear and \\\\ntear caused by the ball striking the uncovered wooden surface of the blade. \\\\n5.6 Contact with the ball \\\\nIn these clauses, \\\\n5.6.1 reference to the bat shall imply that the bat is held in the batter’s hand or a glove worn on his hand, unless \\\\nstated otherwise. \\\\n5.6.2 contact between the ball and any of 5.6.2.1 to 5.6.2.4 \\\\n5.6.2.1 the bat itself \\\\n5.6.2.2 the batter’s hand holding the bat \\\\n5.6.2.3 any part of a glove worn on the batter’s hand holding the bat \\\\n5.6.2.4 any additional materials permitted under 5.4 \\\\nshall be regarded as the ball striking or touching the bat or being struck by the bat. \\\\n5.7 Bat size limits \\\\n5.7.1 The overall length of the bat, when the lower portion of the handle is inserted, shall not be more than 38 \\\\nin/96.52 cm. \\\\n5.7.2 The blade of the bat shall not exceed the following dimensions: \\\\nWidth: 4.25in / 10.8 cm \\\\nDepth: 2.64in / 6.7 cm \\\\nEdges: 1.56in / 4.0cm. \\\\nFurthermore, it should also be able to pass through a bat gauge as described in paragraph 1.6 of Appendix \\\\nB. \\\\n5.7.3 The handle shall not exceed 52% of the overall length of the bat. \\\\n5.7.4 The material permitted for covering the blade in clause 5.4.1 shall not exceed 0.04 in/0.1 cm in thickness. \\\\n5.7.5 The maximum permitted thickness of protective material placed on the toe of the blade is 0.12 in/0.3 cm. \\\\n5.8 Categories of bat \\\\n5.8.1 Type A bats conform to clauses 5.1 to 5.7 inclusive. \\\\n5.8.2 Only Type A bats may be used in ODI matches. \\\\n \\\\n6 THE PITCH \\\\n6.1 Area of pitch \\\\nThe pitch is a rectangular area of the ground 22 yards/20.12 m in length and 10 ft/3.05 m in width. It is bounded at \\\\neither end by the bowling creases and on either side by imaginary lines, one each side of the imaginary line joining \\\\nthe centres of the two middle stumps, each parallel to it and 5 ft/1.52 m from it. If the pitch is next to an artificial pitch \\\\nwhich is closer than 5 ft/1.52 m from the middle stumps, the pitch on that side will extend only to the junction of the \\\\ntwo surfaces. See clauses 8.1 (Description, width and pitching),  7.2 (The bowling crease) and Appendix C. \\\\n \\\\n10 \\\\n6.2 Fitness of pitch for play \\\\nThe umpires shall be the sole judges of the fitness of the pitch for play. See clauses 2.7 (Fitness for play) and 2.8 \\\\n(Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable conditions). \\\\n6.3 Selection and preparation \\\\nBefore the match, the Ground Authority shall be responsible for the selection and preparation of the pitch. During the \\\\nmatch, the umpires shall control its use and maintenance. \\\\n6.3.1 The Ground Authority shall ensure that during the period prior to the start of play and during intervals, the \\\\npitch area shall be roped off so as to prevent unauthorised access. (The pitch area shall include an area at \\\\nleast 2 metres beyond the rectangle made by the crease markings at both ends of the pitch). \\\\n6.3.2 The fourth umpire shall ensure that, prior to the start of play and during any intervals, only authorised staff, \\\\nICC designated persons, the ICC match officials, players, team coaches and authorised television personnel \\\\nshall be allowed access to the pitch area. Such access shall be subject to the following limitations: \\\\n6.3.2.1 Only captains and team coaches may walk on the actual playing surface of the pitch area (outside \\\\nof the crease markings). \\\\n6.3.2.2 Access to the pitch area by television personnel shall be restricted to one camera crew (including \\\\none or two television commentators) of the official licensed television broadcaster(s) (but not news \\\\ncrews). \\\\n6.3.2.3 No spiked footwear shall be permitted. \\\\n6.3.2.4 No one shall be permitted to bounce a ball on the pitch, strike it with a bat or cause damage to the \\\\npitch in any other way. \\\\n6.3.2.5 Access shall not interfere with pitch preparation. \\\\n6.3.3 In the event of any dispute, the ICC Match Referee will rule and his ruling will be final. \\\\n6.4 Changing the pitch \\\\n6.4.1 If the on-field umpires decide that it is dangerous or unreasonable for play to continue on the match pitch, \\\\nthey shall stop play and immediately advise the ICC Match Referee. \\\\n6.4.2 The on-field umpires and the ICC Match Referee shall then consult with both captains. \\\\n6.4.3 If the captains agree to continue, play shall resume. \\\\n6.4.4 If the decision is not to resume play, the on-field umpires together with the ICC Match Referee shall consider \\\\nwhether the existing pitch can be repaired and the match resumed from the point it was stopped. In \\\\nconsidering whether to authorise such repairs, the ICC Match Referee must consider whether this would \\\\nplace either side at an unfair advantage, given the play that had already taken place on the dangerous pitch. \\\\n6.4.5 If the decision is that the existing pitch cannot be repaired, then the match is to be abandoned with the \\\\nfollowing consequences:  \\\\n6.4.5.1 In the event of the required number of overs to constitute a match having been completed at the \\\\ntime the match is abandoned, the result shall be determined according to the provisions of clause \\\\n16.4.2. \\\\n6.4.5.2 In the event of the required number of overs to constitute a match not having been completed, the \\\\nmatch will be abandoned as a no result. \\\\n6.4.6 If the abandonment occurs on the day of the match, the ICC Match Referee shall consult with the   ICC \\\\nEvent Technical Committee with the objective of finding a way for a new match (including a new nomination \\\\nof teams and toss) to commence on the same date and venue. Such a match may be played either on the \\\\nrepaired pitch or on another pitch, subject to the ICC Match Referee and the relevant Ground Authority both \\\\nbeing satisfied that the new pitch will be of the required ODI standard. The playing time lost between the \\\\n \\\\n11 \\\\nscheduled start time of the original match and the actual start time of the new match will be covered by the \\\\nprovisions of clause 12. \\\\n6.4.7 If it is not possible to start a new match on the scheduled day of the match,(including any reserve day), the \\\\nmatch will be abandoned as a no result.  \\\\n6.4.8 Throughout the above decision making processes, the ICC Match Referee shall keep informed both \\\\ncaptains and the head of the Ground Authority. The head of the Ground Authority shall ensure that suitable \\\\nand prompt public announcements are made. \\\\n6.5 Non-turf pitches \\\\nAll  ODI matches shall be played on natural turf pitches. \\\\nThe use of PVA and other adhesives in the preparation of pitches is not permitted. \\\\n6.6 Junior Cricket \\\\nShall not apply. \\\\n7 THE CREASES \\\\n7.1 The creases \\\\nThe positions of a bowling crease, a popping crease and two return creases shall be marked by white lines, as set \\\\nout in clauses 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4, at each end of the pitch. See paragraph 1 of Appendix C. \\\\n7.2 The bowling crease \\\\nThe bowling crease, which is the back edge of the crease marking, is the line that marks the end of the pitch, as in \\\\nclause 6.1 (Area of pitch). It shall be 8 ft 8 in/2.64 m in length. \\\\n7.3 The popping crease \\\\nThe popping crease, which is the back edge of the crease marking, shall be in front of and parallel to the bowling \\\\ncrease and shall be 4 ft/1.22 m from it. The popping crease shall be marked to a minimum of 15 yards/13.71 m on \\\\neither side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps and shall be considered to be unlimited \\\\nin length. \\\\n7.4 The return creases \\\\nThe return creases, which are the inside edges of the crease markings, shall be at right angles to the popping crease \\\\nat a distance of 4 ft 4 in/1.32 m either side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps. Each \\\\nreturn crease shall be marked from the popping crease to a minimum of 8 ft/2.44 m behind it and shall be considered \\\\nto be unlimited in length. \\\\n7.5 Additional Crease Markings \\\\nAs a guideline to the umpires for the calling of Wides on the offside, the crease markings detailed in paragraph 1 of \\\\nAppendix C may be marked in white at each end of the pitch. \\\\n8 THE WICKETS \\\\n8.1 Description, width and pitching \\\\nTwo sets of wickets shall be pitched opposite and parallel to each other in the centres of the bowling creases. Each \\\\nset shall be 9 in/22.86 cm wide and shall consist of three wooden stumps with two wooden bails on top. See \\\\nparagraph 2 of Appendix B. \\\\n \\\\n12 \\\\n8.2 Size of stumps \\\\nThe tops of the stumps shall be 28 in/71.12 cm above the playing surface and shall be dome shaped except for the \\\\nbail grooves. The portion of a stump above the playing surface shall be cylindrical apart from the domed top, with \\\\ncircular section of diameter not less than 1.38 in/3.50 cm nor more than 1.5 in/3.81 cm. See paragraph 2 of Appendix \\\\nB. \\\\nFor televised matches the  broadcaster may provide a slightly larger cylindrical stump to accommodate the stump \\\\ncamera. When the larger stump is used, all three stumps must be exactly the same size. \\\\n8.3 The bails \\\\n8.3.1 The bails, when in position on top of the stumps, \\\\n- shall not project more than 0.5 in/1.27 cm above them. \\\\n- shall fit between the stumps without forcing them out of the vertical. \\\\n8.3.2 Each bail shall conform to the following specifications. See paragraph 2 of Appendix B. \\\\nOverall length 4.31 in/10.95 cm \\\\nLength of barrel 2.13 in /5.40 cm \\\\nLonger spigot 1.38 in/3.50 cm \\\\nShorter spigot 0.81 in/2.06 cm. \\\\n8.3.3 The two spigots and the barrel shall have the same centre line. \\\\n8.3.4 Devices aimed at protecting player safety by limiting the distance that a bail can travel off the stumps will be \\\\nallowed, subject to the approval of  the ICC. \\\\n8.4 Dispensing with bails \\\\nThe umpires may agree to dispense with the use of bails, if necessary. If they so agree then no bails shall be used at \\\\neither end. The use of bails shall be resumed as soon as conditions permit. See clause 29.5 (Dispensing with bails). \\\\n8.5 LED Wickets \\\\n LED wickets will be used in all matches. Refer also to paragraphs 3.8.1.6 and 4.2 of Appendix D.  \\\\n9 PREPARATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE PLAYING \\\\nAREA \\\\n9.1 Rolling \\\\nThe pitch shall not be rolled during the match except as permitted in clauses 9.1.1 and 9.1.2. \\\\n9.1.1 Frequency and duration of rolling \\\\nDuring the match the pitch may be rolled at the request of the captain of the side batting second, for a period \\\\nof not more than 7 minutes, before the start of the second innings. \\\\n9.1.2 Rolling after a delayed start \\\\nIn addition to the rolling permitted above, if, after the toss and before the first innings of the match, the start \\\\nis delayed, the captain of the batting side may request that the pitch be rolled for not more than 7 minutes. \\\\nHowever, if the umpires together agree that the delay has had no significant effect on the state of the pitch, \\\\nthey shall refuse such request for rolling of the pitch. \\\\n9.1.3 Choice of rollers \\\\n \\\\n13 \\\\nIf there is more than one roller available the captain of the batting side shall choose which one is to be used. \\\\nThe following shall apply in addition to clause 9.1: \\\\n9.1.4 Prior to the scheduled time for the toss, the artificial drying of the pitch and outfield shall be at the discretion \\\\nof the Ground Authority. Thereafter and throughout the match the drying of the outfield may be undertaken \\\\nat any time by the Ground Authority, but the drying of the affected area of the pitch shall be carried out only \\\\non the instructions and under the supervision of the umpires. The umpires shall be empowered to have the \\\\npitch dried without reference to the captains at any time they are of the opinion that it is unfit for play. \\\\n9.1.5 The umpires may instruct the Ground Authority to use any available equipment, including any roller for the \\\\npurpose of drying the pitch and making it fit for play. \\\\n9.1.6 An absorbent roller may be used to remove water from the covers including the cover on the match pitch. \\\\n9.2 Clearing debris from the pitch \\\\n9.2.1 The pitch shall be cleared of any debris \\\\n9.2.1.1 between innings. This shall precede rolling if any is to take place. \\\\n9.2.1.2 at all intervals for meals. \\\\n9.2.2 The clearance of debris in clause 9.2.1 shall be done by sweeping, except where the umpires consider that \\\\nthis may be detrimental to the surface of the pitch. In this case the debris must be cleared from that area by \\\\nhand, without sweeping. \\\\n9.2.3 In addition to 9.2.1, debris may be cleared from the pitch by hand, without sweeping, before mowing and \\\\nwhenever either umpire considers it necessary. \\\\n9.3 Mowing \\\\n9.3.1 Responsibility for mowing \\\\n9.3.1.1 All mowings which are carried out before the match shall be the sole responsibility of the Ground \\\\nAuthority. \\\\n9.4 Watering the pitch \\\\nThe pitch shall not be watered during the match. \\\\n9.5 Re-marking creases \\\\nCreases shall be re-marked whenever either umpire considers it necessary. \\\\n9.6 Maintenance of footholes \\\\nThe umpires shall ensure that the holes made by the bowlers and batters are cleaned out and dried whenever \\\\nnecessary to facilitate play. \\\\nThe umpires shall allow, if necessary, the returfing of footholes made by the bowlers in their delivery strides, or the \\\\nuse of quick-setting fillings for the same purpose. \\\\nIn addition, the umpires shall see that wherever possible and whenever it is considered necessary, action is taken \\\\nduring all intervals in play to do whatever is practicable to improve the bowler’s footholes.  \\\\n9.7 Securing of footholds and maintenance of pitch \\\\nDuring play, umpires shall allow the players to secure their footholds by the use of sawdust provided that no damage \\\\nto the pitch is caused and that clause 41 (Unfair play) is not contravened. \\\\n \\\\n14 \\\\n9.8 Protection and preparation of adjacent pitches during \\\\nmatches \\\\nThe protection (by way of an appropriate cover) and preparation of pitches which are adjacent to the match pitch will \\\\nbe permitted during the match subject to the following: \\\\n9.8.1 Such measures will only be possible if requested by the Ground Authority and approved by the umpires \\\\nbefore the start of the match. \\\\n9.8.2 Approval should only be granted where such measures are unavoidable and will not compromise the safety \\\\nof the players or their ability to execute their actions with complete freedom. \\\\n9.8.3 The preparation work shall be carried out under the supervision of the fourth umpire. \\\\n9.8.4 The consent of the captains is not required but the umpires shall advise both captains and the ICC Match \\\\nReferee before the start of the match on what has been agreed. \\\\n10 COVERING THE PITCH \\\\n10.1 Before the match \\\\nThe use of covers before the match is the responsibility of the Ground Authority and may include full covering if \\\\nrequired. \\\\nThe pitch shall be entirely protected against rain up to the commencement of play. \\\\nHowever, the Ground Authority shall grant suitable facility to the captains to inspect the pitch before the nomination of \\\\ntheir players and to the umpires to discharge their duties as laid down in clauses 2 (The umpires), 6 (The pitch), 7 \\\\n(The creases), 8 (The wickets), and 9 (Preparation and maintenance of the playing area). \\\\n10.2 During the match \\\\nThe pitch shall be entirely protected against rain up to the commencement of play, and for the duration of the period \\\\nof the match. \\\\nThe covers must totally protect the pitch and also the pitch surroundings, to a minimum of 5 metres either side of the \\\\npitch, and any worn or soft areas in the outfield. \\\\nThe bowlers’ run-ups shall be covered during inclement weather, in order to keep them dry, to a distance of at least \\\\n10 x 10 metres. \\\\n10.3 Removal of covers \\\\nAll covers (including “hessian” or “scrim” covers used to protect the pitch against the sun) shall be removed not later \\\\nthan 2 ½ hours before the scheduled start of play provided it is not raining at the time, but the pitch will be covered \\\\nagain if rain falls prior to the commencement of play. \\\\n11 INTERVALS \\\\n11.1 An interval \\\\n11.1.1 The following shall be classed as intervals. \\\\n- Intervals between innings. \\\\n- Intervals for drinks. \\\\n- Any other agreed interval. \\\\n11.1.2 Only these intervals shall be considered as scheduled breaks for the purposes of clause 24.2.6 (fielder \\\\nabsent or leaving the field of play). \\\\n \\\\n15 \\\\n11.2 Duration of interval \\\\n11.2.1 There shall be a 30 minute interval between innings, taken from the call of Time before the interval until the \\\\ncall of Play on resumption after the interval. \\\\n11.3 Allowance for interval between innings \\\\n   Shall not apply. \\\\n11.4 Changing agreed times of intervals \\\\n11.4.1 If the innings of the team batting first is completed prior to the scheduled time for the interval, the interval \\\\nshall take place immediately and the innings of the team batting second will commence after the interval. \\\\nNote:   The prescribed interval timings above may be reduced by the ICC Match Referee taking into account \\\\nthe intention of not having a prolonged interval after a lengthy interruption close to the conclusion of the \\\\ninnings of the team batting first. However, the minimum interval shall not be less than 10 minutes.  \\\\n11.5 Intervals for drinks \\\\n11.5.1 Two drinks breaks per session shall be permitted, each 1 hour 10 minutes apart. Under conditions of \\\\nextreme heat the umpires may permit extra intervals for drinks.  \\\\n11.5.2 An individual player may be given a drink either on the boundary edge or at the fall of a wicket, on the field, \\\\nprovided that no playing time is wasted.

Once notified, the decision cannot be changed. \\\\n13.6 Duration of Match \\\\n13.6.1 All matches will consist of one innings per side, each innings being limited to a maximum of 50 overs.  \\\\n \\\\n13.6.2 All matches shall be of one day’s scheduled duration.  \\\\n \\\\n13.6.3 The Semi-Finals and Final shall have a reserve day allocated on which an incomplete match shall be \\\\ncontinued from the scheduled day. Refer to clause 12.7. No other matches shall have a reserve day allocated.  \\\\n \\\\n13.6.4 If the reserve day is allocated, every effort will be made to complete the match on the scheduled day with any \\\\nnecessary reduction in overs taking place and only if the minimum number of overs necessary to constitute a match \\\\ncannot be bowled on the scheduled day will the match be completed on the reserve day.  \\\\n \\\\n13.6.5 If the match has started on the scheduled day and overs are subsequently reduced following an interruption, \\\\nbut no further play is possible, the match will resume on the reserve day at the point where the last ball was played. \\\\nRefer Appendix I. \\\\n13.7 Length of Innings \\\\n13.7.1 Uninterrupted Matches. \\\\n13.7.1.1 Each team shall bat for 50 overs unless all out earlier.  \\\\n13.7.1.2 If the team fielding first fails to bowl the required number of overs by the scheduled time for \\\\ncessation of the first innings, play shall continue until the required number of overs has been \\\\nbowled.  Subject to clause 11.4, the interval shall be fixed at 30 minutes. The team batting second \\\\nshall receive its full quota of 50 overs irrespective of the number of overs it bowled in the scheduled \\\\ntime for the cessation of the first innings.  \\\\n13.7.1.3 If the team batting first is dismissed in less than 50 overs, the team batting second shall be entitled \\\\nto bat for 50 overs.  \\\\n \\\\n18 \\\\n13.7.1.4 If the team fielding second fails to bowl 50 overs by the scheduled cessation time, the hours of play \\\\nshall be extended until the required number of overs has been bowled or a result is achieved.  \\\\n13.7.1.5 Penalties shall apply for slow over rates (refer to the ICC Code of Conduct). \\\\n13.7.2 Delayed or Interrupted Matches  \\\\n13.7.2.1 Delay or Interruption to the Innings of the Team Batting First (see paragraph 1 of Appendix E) \\\\n13.7.2.1.1 When playing time has been lost the revised number of overs to be bowled in the \\\\nmatch shall be based on a rate of 14.28 overs per hour, which is inclusive of the \\\\nprovision of drinks intervals, in the total remaining time available for play. \\\\n13.7.2.1.2 The revision of the number of overs should ensure, whenever possible, that both \\\\nteams have the opportunity of batting for the same number of overs. The team \\\\nbatting second shall not bat for a greater number of overs than the first team unless \\\\nthe latter completed its innings in less than its allocated overs. To constitute a \\\\nmatch, a minimum of 20 overs have to be bowled to the side batting second, \\\\nsubject to a result not being achieved earlier. For the semi-finals and final, a \\\\nminimum of 25 overs have to be bowled to the side batting second, subject to a \\\\nresult not being achieved earlier \\\\n13.7.2.1.3 As soon as the total minutes of playing time remaining is less than the completed \\\\novers faced by Team 1 multiplied by 4.2, then the first innings is terminated and the \\\\nprovisions of 13.7.2.2 below take effect. \\\\n13.7.2.1.4 A fixed time will be specified for the commencement of the interval, and also the \\\\nclose of play for the match, by applying a rate of 14.28 overs per hour. When \\\\ncalculating the length of playing time available for the match, or the length of either \\\\ninnings, the timing and duration of all relative delays, extensions in playing hours, \\\\ninterruptions in play, and intervals, excluding those for drinks, will be taken into \\\\nconsideration. This calculation must not cause the match to finish earlier than the \\\\noriginal or rescheduled time for cessation of play on the final scheduled day for \\\\nplay. If required the original time shall be extended to allow for one extra over for \\\\neach team.  \\\\n13.7.2.1.5 If the team fielding first fails to bowl the revised number of overs by the specified \\\\ntime, play shall continue until the required number of overs have been bowled or \\\\nthe innings is completed.  \\\\n13.7.2.1.6 Penalties shall apply for slow over rates (refer to the ICC Code of Conduct). \\\\n \\\\n13.7.2.2 Delay or Interruption to the innings of the Team Batting Second (see paragraph 2 of Appendix E) \\\\n13.7.2.2.1 When playing time has been lost and, as a result, it is not possible for the team \\\\nbatting second to have the opportunity of receiving its allocated, or revised \\\\nallocation of overs in the playing time available, the number of overs shall be \\\\nreduced at a rate of 14.28 overs per hour, which is inclusive of the provision of \\\\ndrinks intervals, in respect of the lost playing time. Should the calculations result in \\\\na fraction of an over the fraction shall be ignored.  \\\\n13.7.2.2.2 In addition, should the innings of the team batting first have been completed prior to \\\\nthe scheduled, or re-scheduled time for the commencement of the interval, then \\\\nany calculation relating to the revision of overs shall not be effective until an \\\\namount of time equivalent to that by which the second innings started early has \\\\nelapsed.  \\\\n13.7.2.2.3 To constitute a match, a minimum of 20 overs have to be bowled to the team \\\\nbatting second subject to a result not being achieved earlier. For the semi-finals \\\\nand final, a minimum of 25 overs have to be bowled to the side batting second, \\\\nsubject to a result not being achieved earlier \\\\n13.7.2.2.4 The team batting second shall not bat for a greater number of overs than the first \\\\nteam unless the latter completed its innings in less than its allocated overs.  \\\\n13.7.2.2.5 A fixed time will be specified for the close of play by applying a rate of 14.28 overs \\\\nper hour. With the exception of drinks intervals, the timing and duration of all \\\\n \\\\n19 \\\\nrelative delays, extensions in playing hours and interruptions in play, will be taken \\\\ninto consideration in specifying this time.  \\\\n13.7.2.2.6 If the team fielding second fails to bowl the revised overs by the scheduled or re-\\\\nscheduled close of play, the hours of play shall be extended until the overs have \\\\nbeen bowled or a result achieved. \\\\n13.7.2.2.7 Penalties shall apply for slow over rates (refer to the ICC Code of Conduct). \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n13.7.3 Extra Time \\\\n13.7.3.1 There shall be a maximum of 60 minutes of extra time allocated to all group matches.  \\\\n13.7.3.2 There shall be a maximum of 120 minutes of extra time allocated to the semi-finals and the final, and an \\\\nadditional maximum of 120 minutes allocated to their reserve day.  \\\\n                                         13.8 Over-Rate Penalties \\\\n13.8.1 The fielding side shall be in position to bowl the first ball of the final over of the innings by the scheduled (or \\\\nre-scheduled) cessation time for the innings (calculated in accordance with clause 13.7). In delayed or interrupted \\\\nmatches where there has been a reduction of 3 or more overs pursuant to clause 13.7.2, the fielding side shall be in \\\\nposition to bowl the first ball of the penultimate over of the innings by the scheduled (or re-scheduled) cessation time \\\\nfor the innings. \\\\n13.8.2 Where this requirement is not met, clause 28.7.2.2.3 shall be varied and from the start of the next over after \\\\nthe point in time at which the cessation time is reached (and for the remainder of the innings) no more than 4 fielders \\\\nshall be permitted outside the fielding restriction area referred to in clause 28.7.2.1. \\\\n13.8.3 Clause 13.8.2 shall not apply where: \\\\n13.8.3.1 a side’s innings is reduced to less than 25 overs, unless the over-rate penalty has been applied prior to such \\\\nreduction; or \\\\n13.8.3.2 a side’s innings is completed prior to the scheduled (or re-scheduled) cessation time for the innings. \\\\n13.8.4 The bowler’s end umpire shall inform the captain of the fielding side, the batter and the other umpire of: \\\\n13.8.4.1 the scheduled cessation time for the innings prior to the start of the innings, and of any re-scheduled \\\\ncessation time following any subsequent interruption to play; and \\\\n13.8.4.2 any time allowances pursuant to clause 12.8.3 as and when they arise. \\\\n13.8.5 Over-rate penalties pursuant to clause 13.8 shall be applied in addition to the relevant provisions under the \\\\nICC Code of Conduct. \\\\n13.9 Number of Overs per Bowler \\\\n13.9.1 No bowler shall bowl more than 10 overs in an innings.  \\\\n13.9.2 In a delayed or interrupted match where the overs are reduced for both teams or for the team bowling \\\\nsecond, no bowler may bowl more than one-fifth of the total overs allowed.  \\\\n13.9.3 Where the total overs is not divisible by 5, one additional over shall be allowed to the maximum number per \\\\nbowler necessary to make up the balance.  \\\\n13.9.4 In the event of a bowler breaking down and being unable to complete an over, the remaining balls will be \\\\nallowed by another bowler. Such part of an over will count as a full over only in so far as each bowler’s limit \\\\nis concerned.  \\\\n13.9.5 The scoreboard shall show the total number of overs bowled and the number of overs bowled by each \\\\nbowler.  \\\\n \\\\n20 \\\\n14 THE FOLLOW-ON \\\\nShall not apply. \\\\n15 DECLARATION AND FORFEITURE \\\\nShall not apply. \\\\n16 THE RESULT \\\\n16.1 A Win – one-innings match \\\\n16.1.1 Unless the winner is determined by DLS (see clause 16.4), the side which has scored in its one innings a \\\\ntotal of runs in excess of that scored by the opposing side in its one completed innings shall win the match. \\\\nSee clause 13.3 (Completed innings). Note also clause 16.5 (Winning hit or extras). \\\\n16.1.2 Save for circumstances where a match is awarded to a team as a consequence of the opposing team’s \\\\nrefusal to play (clause 16.2), a result can be achieved only if both teams have had the opportunity of batting \\\\nfor at least 20 overs, unless one team has been all out in less than 20 overs or unless the team batting \\\\nsecond scores enough runs to win in less than 20 overs (25 overs in the semi-finals and final). \\\\n16.1.3 Save for circumstances where a match is awarded to a team as a consequence of the opposing team’s \\\\nrefusal to play (clause 16.2), all matches in which both teams have not had an opportunity of batting for a \\\\nminimum of 20 overs, shall be declared a No Result (25 overs in the semi-finals and final). \\\\n16.2 ICC Match Referee awarding a match \\\\n16.2.1 A match shall be lost by a side which either \\\\n16.2.1.1 concedes defeat or \\\\n16.2.1.2 in the opinion of the ICC Match Referee refuses to play and the ICC Match Referee shall award the \\\\nmatch to the other side. \\\\n16.2.2 If an umpire considers that an action by any player or players might constitute a refusal by either side to play \\\\nthen the umpires together shall inform the ICC Match Referee of this fact. The ICC Match Referee shall \\\\ntogether with the umpires ascertain the cause of the action. If the ICC Match Referee, after due consultation \\\\nwith the umpires, then decides that this action does constitute a refusal to play by one side, he/she shall so \\\\ninform the captain of that side. If the captain persists in the action the ICC Match Referee shall award the \\\\nmatch in accordance with clause 16.2.1.2 above. \\\\n16.2.3 If action as in clause 16.2.2 above takes place after play has started and does not constitute a refusal to \\\\nplay the delay or interruption in play shall be dealt with in the same manner as provided for in clauses 13.7.2 \\\\n(Delayed and Interrupted Matches) and 11.4 (Changing agreed times for intervals) above. \\\\nNote: In addition to the consequences of any refusal to play prescribed under this clause, any such \\\\nrefusal, whether temporary or final, may result in disciplinary action being taken against the captain and \\\\nteam responsible under the ICC Code of Conduct. \\\\n16.3 A Tie or No Result \\\\n16.3.1 A Tie \\\\n16.3.1.1 The result of a match shall be a tie when both innings have been completed and the scores are equal. \\\\n \\\\n16.3.1.2 For all matches throughout the event, if the match is tied a Super Over is played. If the Super Over is a tie, \\\\nthen subsequent Super Overs shall be played until there is a winner. Unless exceptional circumstances \\\\narise, there shall be an unlimited number of Super Overs played to achieve a result. Refer to Appendix G \\\\n \\\\n16.3.2 No Result \\\\n \\\\n21 \\\\n16.3.2.1 See clause 16.1.3 above. \\\\n16.4 Calculation of the Target Score \\\\n16.4.1 Interrupted Matches \\\\n16.4.1.1 If, due to suspension of play after the start of the match, the number of overs in the innings of either \\\\nteam has to be revised to a lesser number than originally allotted (minimum of 20 overs), then a \\\\nrevised target score (to win) should be set for the number of overs which the team batting second \\\\nwill have the opportunity of facing. This revised target is to be calculated using DLS. The target set \\\\nwill always be a whole number and one run less will constitute a Tie. \\\\n16.4.2 Prematurely Terminated Matches \\\\n16.4.2.1 If the innings of the side batting second is suspended (with at least 20 overs bowled) and it is not \\\\npossible for the match to be resumed, the match will be decided by comparison with the DLS ‘Par \\\\nScore’ determined at the instant of the suspension using DLS. If the score is equal to the par score, \\\\nthe match is a Tie. Otherwise the result is a victory, or defeat, by the margin of runs by which the \\\\nscore exceeds, or falls short of, the Par Score. \\\\n16.5 Winning hit or extras \\\\n16.5.1 As soon as a result is reached as defined in clauses 16.1, 16.2 or 16.3.1, the match is at an end. Nothing \\\\nthat happens thereafter, except as in clause 41.17 (Penalty runs), shall be regarded as part of it. Note also \\\\nclause 16.8. \\\\n16.5.2 The side batting last will have scored enough runs to win only if its total of runs is sufficient without including \\\\nany runs completed by the batters before the completion of a catch, or the obstruction of a catch, from which \\\\nthe striker could be dismissed. \\\\n16.5.3 If a boundary is scored before the batters have completed sufficient runs to win the match, the whole of the \\\\nboundary allowance shall be credited to the side’s total and, in the case of a hit by the bat, to the striker’s \\\\nscore. \\\\n16.6 Statement of result \\\\nIf the side batting last wins the match without losing all its wickets, the result shall be stated as a win by the number of \\\\nwickets still then to fall, unless clause 16.4.2.1 (Prematurely Terminated Matches – Calculation of the Target Score) \\\\napplies. \\\\nIf, without having scored a total of runs in excess of the total scored by the opposing side, the innings of the side \\\\nbatting last has been completed, but as the result of an award of 5 Penalty runs its total of runs is then sufficient to \\\\nwin, the result shall be stated as a win to that side by Penalty runs. \\\\nIf the side fielding last wins the match, the result shall be stated as a win by runs. \\\\nIf the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as Match \\\\nConceded or Match Awarded, as the case may be. \\\\n16.7 Correctness of result \\\\nAny decision as to the correctness of the scores shall be the responsibility of the umpires. See clause 2.15 \\\\n(Correctness of scores). \\\\n16.8 Mistakes in scoring \\\\nIf, after the players and umpires have left the field in the belief that the match has been concluded, the umpires \\\\ndiscover that a mistake in scoring has occurred which affects the result then, subject to clause 16.9, they shall adopt \\\\nthe following procedure. \\\\n16.8.1 If, when the players leave the field, the side batting last has not completed its innings and \\\\neither the number of overs to be bowled in that innings has not been completed, or \\\\n \\\\n22 \\\\nthe end of the innings has not been reached, \\\\nthen, unless one side concedes defeat, the umpires shall order play to resume. \\\\nUnless a result is reached sooner, play will then continue, if conditions permit, until the prescribed number of \\\\novers has been completed. The number of overs shall be taken as they were at the call of Time for the \\\\nsupposed conclusion of the match. No account shall be taken of the time between that moment and the \\\\nresumption of play. \\\\n16.8.2 If, at this call of Time, the overs have been completed and no Playing time remains, or if the side batting last \\\\nhas completed its innings, the umpires shall immediately inform both captains of the necessary corrections \\\\nto the scores and to the result. \\\\n16.9 Result not to be changed \\\\nOnce the umpires have agreed with the scorers the correctness of the scores at the conclusion of the match – see \\\\nclauses 2.15 (Correctness of scores) and 3.2 (Correctness of scores) – the result cannot thereafter be changed. \\\\n16.9.1  \\\\nclauses 2.15 (Correctness of scores) and 3.2 (Correctness of scores) – the result cannot thereafter be changed. \\\\n16.10  Competition Format \\\\n16.10.1 Competition format \\\\nThe ICC Champions Trophy 2025 will be contested by the following eight teams which have been seeded and divided \\\\ninto two groups of four teams as follows: \\\\n Group A        Group B \\\\n1. India    2. South Africa \\\\n4. New Zealand   3. Australia \\\\n5. Pakistan    6. Afghanistan \\\\n8. Bangladesh   7. England \\\\nThe first round of the competition will be the group stage. \\\\nIn the group stage, each team will play every other team in its group once. \\\\nPoints will be allocated for each match in accordance with the system described in clause 16.10.2 of these playing \\\\nconditions.  \\\\nFollowing the group stage, the top two teams in each group will progress to the Semi-Finals as follows: \\\\nA1 will play against B2 in a Semi-Final, and  \\\\nB1 will play against A2 in a Semi-Final. \\\\nNote: \\\\n- If India qualifies for a semi-final, they will play in Semi-Final 1 in Dubai on the 4 March. \\\\n- If Pakistan qualifies for a semi-final, they will play in Semi-Final 2 in Lahore on the 5 March. \\\\nThe winners of the Semi-Finals will contest the Final of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025. \\\\nNote: \\\\n- The Final will be played in Lahore on the 9 March, unless India qualifies, in which case the \\\\nFinal will be played in Dubai. \\\\n \\\\n23 \\\\nProgression of Teams \\\\n16.10.2 Group Matches \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nThe following points system shall apply: \\\\nWin      2 \\\\nNo result or abandoned    1 \\\\nTie followed by the abandonment of the Super Over 1 \\\\nLoss      0 \\\\nIn the event of teams finishing on equal points in its group, the ordering of teams will be decided in the following order \\\\nof priority: \\\\n- The team with the greatest number of wins in its group matches will be placed in the higher \\\\nposition. \\\\n \\\\n- If there are teams with equal points and equal wins in its group, then in such case the teams \\\\nwill be ordered according to their net run rate (NRR) in the group matches (refer to 16.10.5 \\\\nbelow for the calculation of NRR). \\\\n \\\\n- If two or more teams are still equal, they will be ordered according to the result of the head-to-\\\\nhead match played between them in their group (points, then if still equal, NRR in those \\\\nmatches). \\\\n \\\\n- If the above does not resolve the group ordering, or if all matches within a group produce no \\\\nresults, the teams will be ordered as per their original group seedings. \\\\n16.10.3 Semi-Final \\\\n-     If a Semi-Final is tied, the teams shall compete in a Super Over to determine which team   \\\\nprogresses to the Final. Refer to attached Appendix G. \\\\n- If following a tie, weather conditions prevent the Super Over from being completed, or if the match \\\\nis abandoned or a no result at the end of the reserve day, then the team that proceeds to the Final \\\\nwill be the team that finished in the higher position in its group. \\\\n16.10 4 Final \\\\n- In the event of a tied Final, the teams shall compete in a Super Over to determine which team is \\\\nthe winner. Refer to attached Appendix G.  \\\\n- If following a tie, weather conditions prevent the Super Over from being completed, or if the match      \\\\nis abandoned or a no result at the end of the reserve day, the teams shall be declared joint \\\\nwinners. \\\\n16.10.5 Net Run Rate  \\\\nA team’s net run rate is calculated by deducting from the average runs per over scored by that team \\\\nthroughout the competition, the average runs per over scored against that team throughout the competition.  \\\\nIn the event of a team being all out in less than its full quota of overs, the calculation of its net run rate shall \\\\nbe based on the full quota of overs to which it would have been entitled and not on the number of overs in \\\\nwhich the team was dismissed.  \\\\n \\\\n24 \\\\nNote: All runs scored and overs bowled during Super Overs are disregarded for net run rate calculation \\\\npurposes. \\\\nOnly those matches where results are achieved will count for the purpose of net run rate calculations. Where \\\\na match is abandoned, but a result is achieved under Duckworth/Lewis/Stern, for net run rate purposes \\\\nTeam 1 will be credited with Team 2’s Par Score on abandonment off the same number of overs faced by \\\\nTeam 2.Where a match is concluded with Duckworth/Lewis/Stern having been applied at an earlier point in \\\\nthe match, Team 1 will be credited with 1 run less than the final Target Score for Team 2 off the total number \\\\nof overs allocated to Team 2 to reach the target.  \\\\nIn circumstances where a Group match (and the points for such match) is awarded to a team as a result of \\\\nthe other team’s refusal to play, either by the match referee in accordance with playing condition 16.2 or in \\\\naccordance with the provisions of the relevant event agreements signed by the participating teams, the net \\\\nrun rate of the participating teams shall be affected as follows.  \\\\nIf the refusal to play occurs after the minimum number of overs required to achieve a result has been \\\\nbowled, the net run rate of the team awarded the win shall be updated as if play had been legitimately \\\\nsuspended when the refusal to play occurred. However the net run rate of the defaulting team shall be \\\\nadjusted by increasing their total overs received by 50, with no adjustment made to their run scored or \\\\nconceded, nor to their total overs bowled.  \\\\n \\\\nIf the refusal to play occurs during the match but prior to the minimum number of overs being bowled to \\\\nachieve a result, or if the match is not started, the net run rate of the team awarded the win will remain \\\\nunchanged (as per a no result). However, the net run rate of the defaulting team shall be adjusted by \\\\nincreasing their total overs received by 50, with no adjustment made to their run scored or conceded, nor to \\\\ntheir total overs bowled.  \\\\n \\\\n17 THE OVER \\\\n17.1 Number of balls \\\\nThe ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 valid balls. \\\\n17.2 Start of an over \\\\nAn over has started when the bowler starts his run-up or, if there is no run-up, starts his action for the first delivery of \\\\nthat over. \\\\n17.3 Validity of balls \\\\n17.3.1 A ball shall not count as one of the 6 balls of the over unless it is delivered, even though, as in clause 38.3 \\\\n(Non-striker leaving his ground early) a batter may be dismissed or some other incident occurs without the \\\\nball having been delivered. \\\\n17.3.2 A ball delivered by the bowler shall not count as one of the 6 balls of the over \\\\n17.3.2.1 if it is called dead, or is to be considered dead, before the striker has had an opportunity to play it. \\\\nSee clause 20.7 (Dead ball; ball counting as one of over). \\\\n17.3.2.2 if it is called dead in the circumstances of clause 20.4.2.6. Note also the special provisions of clause \\\\n20.4.2.5 (Umpire calling and signaling Dead ball) \\\\n17.3.2.3 if it is a No ball. See clause 21 (No ball). \\\\n17.3.2.4 if it is a Wide. See clause 22 (Wide ball). \\\\n17.3.2.5 when any of clauses 24.4 (Player returning without permission), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 41.4 \\\\n(Deliberate attempt to distract striker), or 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of \\\\nbatter) is applied. \\\\n17.3.3 Any deliveries other than those listed in clauses 17.3.1 and 17.3.2 shall be known as valid balls. Only valid \\\\nballs shall count towards the 6 balls of the over. \\\\n \\\\n25 \\\\n17.4 Call of Over \\\\nWhen 6 valid balls have been bowled and when the ball becomes dead, the umpire shall call Over before leaving the \\\\nwicket. See also clause 20.3 (Call of Over or Time). \\\\n17.5 Umpire miscounting \\\\n17.5.1 If the umpire miscounts the number of valid balls, the over as counted by the umpire shall stand. \\\\n17.5.2 If, having miscounted, the umpire allows an over to continue after 6 valid balls have been bowled, he/she \\\\nmay subsequently call Over when the ball becomes dead after any delivery, even if that delivery is not a \\\\nvalid ball. \\\\n17.5.3 Whenever possible, the third umpire shall liaise with the scorers and if possible inform the on-field umpires if \\\\nthe over has been miscounted. \\\\n17.6 Bowler changing ends \\\\nA bowler shall be allowed to change ends as often as desired, provided he does not bowl two overs consecutively, \\\\nnor bowl parts of each of two consecutive overs, in the same innings. \\\\n17.7 Finishing an over \\\\n17.7.1 Other than at the end of an innings, a bowler shall finish an over in progress unless incapacitated or \\\\nsuspended under these Playing Conditions. \\\\n17.7.2 If for any reason, other than the end of an innings, an over is left uncompleted at the start of an interval or \\\\ninterruption, it shall be completed on resumption of play. \\\\n17.8 Bowler incapacitated or suspended during an over \\\\nIf for any reason a bowler is incapacitated while running up to deliver the first ball of an over, or is incapacitated or \\\\nsuspended during an over, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball.  If a bowler is incapacitated or suspended \\\\nduring an over, another bowler shall complete the over from the same end, provided that he does not bowl two overs \\\\nconsecutively, nor bowl parts of each of two consecutive overs, in that innings. \\\\n18 SCORING RUNS \\\\n18.1 A run \\\\nThe score shall be reckoned by runs. A run is scored \\\\n18.1.1 so often as the batters, at any time while the ball is in play, have crossed and made good their ground from \\\\nend to end. \\\\n18.1.2 when a boundary is scored. See clause 19 (Boundaries). \\\\n18.1.3 when Penalty runs are awarded. See clause 18.6. \\\\n18.2 Runs disallowed and runs not scored \\\\nWherever in these Playing Conditions provision is made for the scoring of runs or awarding of penalties, such runs \\\\nand penalties will be subject to any provisions that may be applicable for a run to be disallowed or a run not to be \\\\nscored (see Appendix A 11) or for the non-award of penalties. \\\\nWhen runs are disallowed, the one run penalty for No ball or Wide shall stand and 5 run penalties shall be allowed, \\\\nexcept for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side). \\\\n18.3 Short runs \\\\n18.3.1 A run is short if a batter fails to make good his ground in turning for a further run. \\\\n \\\\n26 \\\\n18.3.2 Although a short run shortens the succeeding one, the latter if completed shall not be regarded as short. A \\\\nstriker setting off for the first run from in front of the popping crease may do so also without penalty. \\\\n18.4 Unintentional short runs \\\\nExcept in the circumstances of clause 18.5, \\\\n18.4.1 if either batter runs a short run, the umpire concerned shall, unless a boundary is scored, call and signal \\\\nShort run as soon as the ball becomes dead and that run shall not be scored. In accordance with paragraph \\\\n2.5 of Appendix D, the third umpire  may assist with any call of Short run and communicate his/her decision \\\\nto the relevant on-field umpire. \\\\n18.4.2 if, after either or both batters run short, a boundary is scored the umpire concerned shall disregard the short \\\\nrunning and shall not call or signal Short run, unless the boundary is a result of an overthrow or wilful act of \\\\na fielder (see clause 19.8 – Overthrow or wilful act of fielder). \\\\n18.4.3 if both batters run short in one and the same run, this shall be regarded as only one short run. \\\\n18.4.4 if more than one run is short then, subject to clauses 18.4.2 and 18.4.3, all runs called as short shall not be \\\\nscored. \\\\n18.4.5 if there has been more than one short run, the umpire shall inform the scorers as to the number of runs to be \\\\nrecorded. \\\\n18.5 Deliberate short runs \\\\n18.5.1 If either umpire considers that one or both batters deliberately ran short at that umpire’s end, the umpire \\\\nconcerned shall, when the ball is dead, call and signal Short run and inform the other umpire of what has \\\\noccurred and apply clause 18.5.2. \\\\n18.5.2 The bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\\\n- return any not out batter to his original end \\\\n- signal No ball or Wide to the scorers, if applicable \\\\n- repeat the Short run signal to the scorers \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side \\\\n- award any other 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective \\\\nhelmets belonging to the fielding side) \\\\n- inform the scorers as to the number of runs to be recorded, and \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the \\\\nreason for this action. \\\\n18.6 Runs awarded for penalties \\\\nRuns shall be awarded for penalties under clauses 18.5 (Deliberate short runs), 21 (No ball), 22 (Wide ball), 24.4 \\\\n(Player returning without permission), 26.4 (Penalties for contravention), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 28.3 (Protective \\\\nhelmets belonging to the fielding side) 41 (Unfair play) and 42 (Players’ conduct). Note, however, the restrictions on \\\\nthe award of Penalty runs in clauses 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded), 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the \\\\nfielding side) and 34 (Hit the ball twice). \\\\n18.7 Runs scored for boundaries \\\\nRuns shall be scored for boundary allowances under clause 19 (Boundaries). \\\\n \\\\n27 \\\\n18.8 Runs scored when a batter is dismissed \\\\nWhen a batter is dismissed, any runs for penalties awarded to either side shall stand. \\\\nNo other runs shall be credited to the batting side, except as follows. \\\\n18.8.1 If a batter is dismissed Obstructing the field, the batting side shall also score any runs completed before the \\\\noffence. \\\\nIf, however, the obstruction or distraction prevented a catch being made, no runs other than penalties shall \\\\nbe scored. \\\\n18.8.2 If a batter is dismissed Run out, the batting side shall also score any runs completed before the wicket was  \\\\nfairly broken. \\\\n18.9 Runs scored when the ball becomes dead other than at the \\\\nfall of a wicket \\\\nWhen the ball becomes dead for any reason other than the fall of a wicket, or is called dead by an umpire, unless \\\\nthere is specific provision otherwise in these Playing Conditions, any runs for penalties awarded to either side shall \\\\nbe scored. Note however the provisions of clauses 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded) and 28.3 (Protective helmets \\\\nbelonging to the fielding side). \\\\nAdditionally the batting side shall be credited with all runs completed by the batters before the incident or call of Dead \\\\nball and the run in progress if the batters had already crossed at the instant of the incident or call of Dead ball. Note \\\\nspecifically, however, the provisions of clause 41.5.8 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter). \\\\n18.10 Crediting of runs scored \\\\nUnless stated otherwise in these Playing Conditions, \\\\n18.10.1 if the ball is struck by the bat, all runs scored by the batting side shall be credited to the striker, except for \\\\nthe following: \\\\n- an award of 5 Penalty runs, which shall be scored as Penalty runs \\\\n- the one run penalty for a No ball, which shall be scored as a No ball extra. \\\\n18.10.2 if the ball is not struck by the bat, runs shall be scored as Penalty runs, Byes, Leg byes, No ball extras or \\\\nWides as the case may be. If Byes or Leg byes accrue from a No ball, only the one run penalty for No ball \\\\nshall be scored as such, and the remainder as Byes or Leg byes as appropriate. \\\\n18.10.3 the bowler shall be debited with: \\\\n- all runs scored by the striker \\\\n- all runs scored as No ball extras \\\\n- all runs scored as Wides. \\\\n18.11 Batter returning to original end \\\\n18.11.1 When the striker is dismissed in any of the circumstances in clauses 18.11.1.1 to 18.11.1.57, the not out \\\\nbatter shall return to his original end. \\\\n18.11.1.1 Bowled. \\\\n18.11.1.2 Stumped. \\\\n18.11.1.3 Hit the ball twice. \\\\n18.11.1.4 LBW. \\\\n18.11.1.5 Hit wicket. \\\\n \\\\n28 \\\\n18.11.1.6 Caught \\\\n18.11.1.7 Obstructing the field, where the obstruction or distraction prevents the striker being out caught. \\\\n18.11.2 The batters shall return to their original ends in any of the cases of clauses 18.11.2.1 to 18.11.2.3. \\\\n18.11.2.1 A boundary is scored unless as a result of an overthrow or wilful act of a fielder (see clause 19.8). \\\\n18.11.2.2 Runs are disallowed for any reason. \\\\n18.11.2.3  the batters at the wicket decide to do so, under clause 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or \\\\nobstruction of batter). \\\\n18.12 Batter returning to wicket he has left \\\\n18.12.1 When a batter is dismissed in any of the ways in clauses 18.12.11 to 18.12.1.2, the not out batter shall \\\\nreturn to the wicket he has left but only if the batters had not already crossed at the instant of the incident \\\\ncausing the dismissal. If runs are to be disallowed, however, the not out batter shall return to his original \\\\nend. \\\\n18.12.1.1 Obstructing the field, where the obstruction or distraction does not prevent the striker being out \\\\nCaught. \\\\n18.12.1.2 Run out. \\\\n18.12.2 If, while a run is in progress, the ball becomes dead for any reason other than the dismissal of a batter, the \\\\nbatters shall return to the wickets they had left, but only if they had not already crossed in running when the \\\\nball became dead. If, however, any of the circumstances of clauses 18.11.2.1 to 18.11.2.3 apply, the batters \\\\nshall return to their original ends. \\\\n19 BOUNDARIES \\\\n19.1 Determining the boundary of the field of play \\\\n19.1.1 Before the toss, the umpires shall determine the boundary of the field of play, which shall be fixed for the \\\\nduration of the match. See clause 2.3.22 (Consultation with  Ground Authority). \\\\n19.1.2 The boundary shall be determined such that no part of any sight-screen, will, at any stage of the match, be \\\\nwithin the field of play. \\\\n19.1.3 The aim shall be to maximize the size of the playing area at each venue. With respect to the size of the \\\\nboundaries, no boundary shall be longer than 90 yards (82.29 meters), and no boundary should be shorter \\\\nthan 65 yards (59.43 metres) from the centre of the pitch to be used. \\\\n19.1.4 At all times, there must be 3 yards (2.74 meters) from the boundary rope to the first solid object (advertising \\\\nboards/LEDs, photographers, cameramen, dug outs, covers, perimeter fence) for the player’s safety run off. \\\\n19.1.5    If the boundary is positioned less than 90 yards (82.29 meters) from the centre of the pitch, the boundary \\\\nrope cannot be set at a distance of more than 10 yards (9.14 meters) from the perimeter fence. The 10 \\\\nyards shall be inclusive of the 3 yards (2.74 meters) provided for the player’s safety run off. \\\\n19.1.6    Any ground which has previously been approved to host international cricket which is unable to conform to \\\\nthe minimum boundary dimension shall be exempt. In such cases the boundary shall be positioned so as to \\\\nmaximize the size of the playing area. \\\\n19.2 Identifying and marking the boundary \\\\n19.2.1 All boundaries must be designated by a rope, or similar object of a minimum standard as authorised by the \\\\nICC from time to time.  \\\\n19.2.2 If the boundary is marked by means of an object that is in contact with the ground the boundary will be the \\\\nedge of the grounded part of the object which is nearest the pitch. \\\\n \\\\n29 \\\\n19.2.3 An obstacle within the field of play shall not be regarded as a boundary unless so determined by the umpires \\\\nbefore the toss. See clause 2.3.2 (Consultation with Ground Authority). \\\\n19.2.4 If an unauthorised person enters the playing arena and handles the ball, the umpire at the bowler’s end shall \\\\nbe the sole judge of whether the boundary allowance should be scored or the ball be treated as still in play \\\\nor called dead ball if a batter is liable to be out as a result of the unauthorised person handling the ball. See \\\\nalso clause 20.4.2.12 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball). \\\\n19.3 Restoring the boundary \\\\nIf a solid object used to mark the boundary is disturbed for any reason, then: \\\\n19.3.1 the boundary shall be considered to be in its original position. \\\\n19.3.2 the object shall be returned to its original position as soon as is practicable; if play is taking place, this shall \\\\nbe as soon as the ball is dead. \\\\n19.3.3 if some part of a fence or other marker has come within the field of play, that part shall be removed from the \\\\nfield of play as soon as is practicable; if play is taking place, this shall be as soon as the ball is dead. \\\\n19.4 Ball grounded beyond the boundary \\\\n19.4.1 The ball in play is grounded beyond the boundary if it touches \\\\n- the boundary or any part of an object used to mark the boundary; \\\\n- the ground beyond the boundary; \\\\n- any object that is grounded beyond the boundary. \\\\n19.4.2 The ball in play is to be regarded as being grounded beyond the boundary if \\\\n- a fielder, grounded beyond the boundary as in clause 19.5, touches the ball; \\\\n- a fielder, after catching the ball within the boundary, becomes grounded beyond the boundary while in \\\\ncontact with the ball, before completing the catch. \\\\n19.5 Fielder grounded beyond the boundary \\\\n19.5.1 A fielder is grounded beyond the boundary if some part of his person is in contact with any of the following: \\\\n- the boundary or any part of an object used to mark the boundary; \\\\n- the ground beyond the boundary; \\\\n- any object that is in contact with the ground beyond the boundary; \\\\n- another fielder who is grounded beyond the boundary. \\\\n19.5.2 A fielder who is not in contact with the ground is considered to be grounded beyond the boundary if his final \\\\ncontact with the ground, before his first contact with the ball after it has been delivered by the bowler, was \\\\nnot entirely within the boundary. \\\\n19.6 Boundary allowances \\\\n19.6.1 6 runs shall be allowed for a boundary 6; and 4 runs for a boundary 4. See also clause 19.7. \\\\n19.7 Runs scored from boundaries \\\\n19.7.1 A boundary 6 will be scored if and only if the ball has been struck by the bat and is first grounded beyond the \\\\nboundary without having been in contact with the ground within the field of play. This shall apply even if the \\\\nball has previously touched a fielder. \\\\n19.7.2 A boundary 4 will be scored when a ball that is grounded beyond the boundary \\\\n \\\\n30 \\\\n- whether struck by the bat or not, was first grounded within the boundary, or \\\\n- has not been struck by the bat. \\\\n19.7.3 When a boundary is scored, the batting side, except in the circumstances of clause 19.8, shall be awarded \\\\nwhichever is the greater of \\\\n19.7.3.1 the allowance for the boundary \\\\n19.7.3.2 the runs completed by the batters together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at \\\\nthe instant the boundary is scored. \\\\n19.7.4 When the runs in clause 19.7.3.2 exceed the boundary allowance they shall replace the boundary allowance \\\\nfor the purposes of clause 18.12.2. \\\\n19.7.5 The scoring of Penalty runs by either side is not affected by the scoring of a boundary. \\\\n19.8 Overthrow or wilful act of fielder \\\\nIf the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be \\\\nany runs for penalties awarded to either side \\\\nand the allowance for the boundary \\\\nand the runs completed by the batters, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of \\\\nthe throw or act. \\\\nClause 18.12.2 (Batter returning to wicket he has left) shall apply as from the instant of the throw or act. \\\\n20 DEAD BALL \\\\n20.1 Ball is dead \\\\n20.1.1 The ball becomes dead when \\\\n20.1.1.1 it is finally settled in the hands of the wicket-keeper or of the bowler. \\\\n20.1.1.2 a boundary is scored. See clause 19.7 (Runs scored from boundaries). \\\\n20.1.1.3 a batter is dismissed. The ball will be deemed to be dead from the instant of the incident causing \\\\nthe dismissal. \\\\n20.1.1.4 whether played or not it becomes trapped between the bat and person of a batter or between items \\\\nof his clothing or equipment. \\\\n20.1.1.5 whether played or not it lodges in the clothing or equipment of a batter or the clothing of an umpire. \\\\n20.1.1.6 there is an award of Penalty runs under either of clauses 24.4 (Player returning without permission) \\\\nor 28.3 (Fielding the ball). The ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n20.1.1.7 there is a contravention of clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side). \\\\n20.1.1.8 the match is concluded in any of the ways stated in clause 12.6 (Conclusion of match). \\\\n20.1.2 The ball shall be considered to be dead when it is clear to the bowler’s end umpire that the fielding side and \\\\nboth batters at the wicket have ceased to regard it as in play. \\\\n20.1.3 In a match where cameras are being used on or over the field of play (e.g. Spidercam), should a ball that \\\\nhas been hit by the batter make contact, while still in play, with the camera, its apparatus or its cable, either \\\\numpire shall call and signal ‘dead ball’. The ball shall not count as one of the over and no runs shall be \\\\nscored. If the delivery was called a No ball it shall count and the No ball penalty shall be applied. No other \\\\nruns (including penalty runs) apart from the No ball penalty shall be scored. \\\\n20.1.4 Should a ball thrown by a fielder make contact with a camera on or over the field of play, its apparatus or its \\\\ncable, either umpire shall call and signal dead ball. Unless this was already a No ball or Wide, the ball shall \\\\n \\\\n31 \\\\ncount as one of the over. All runs scored to that point shall count, plus the run in progress if the batters have \\\\nalready crossed. \\\\n20.1.5 Refer also to paragraph 2.7 of Appendix D. \\\\n20.2 Ball finally settled \\\\nWhether the ball is finally settled or not is a matter for the umpire alone to decide. \\\\n20.3 Call of Over or Time \\\\nNeither the call of Over (see clause 17.4), nor the call of Time (see clause 12.2) is to be made until the ball is dead, \\\\neither under clauses 20.1 or 20.4. \\\\n20.4 Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball \\\\n20.4.1 When the ball has become dead under clause 20.1, the bowler’s end umpire may call and signal Dead ball if \\\\nit is necessary to inform the players. \\\\n20.4.2 Where either umpire is required to call and signal Dead ball under 20.4.2.1 to 20.4.2.14, the ball will be \\\\nconsidered to be dead at the instant of the incident causing the ball to become dead. However, where the \\\\nPlaying Conditions specifically provide for the call to be delayed, so as not to disadvantage the non-\\\\noffending side, under clause 34.4 (Runs permitted from the ball lawfully struck more than once), clause \\\\n41.2.1 (Unfair actions) and clause 42.1.2 (Unacceptable conduct), the ball will be considered to be dead at \\\\nthe point of the call. \\\\nEither umpire shall call and signal Dead ball when \\\\n20.4.2.1 intervening in a case of unfair play. \\\\n20.4.2.2 a possibly serious injury to a player or umpire occurs. \\\\n20.4.2.3 leaving his/her normal position for consultation. \\\\n20.4.2.4 one or both bails fall from the striker’s wicket before the striker has had the opportunity of playing \\\\nthe ball. \\\\n20.4.2.5 the striker is not ready for the delivery of the ball and, if the ball is delivered, makes no attempt to \\\\nplay it. Provided the umpire is satisfied that the striker had adequate reason for not being ready, the \\\\nball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n20.4.2.6 the striker is distracted by any noise or movement or in any other way while preparing to receive, or \\\\nreceiving a delivery. This shall apply whether the source of the distraction is within the match or \\\\noutside it. Note also clause 20.4.2.7. The ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n20.4.2.7 there is an instance of a deliberate attempt to distract under either of clauses 41.4 (Deliberate \\\\nattempt to distract striker) or 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter). The \\\\nball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n20.4.2.8 the bowler drops the ball accidentally before delivery. \\\\n20.4.2.9 the bowler throws the ball towards the striker’s end before entering his/her delivery stride \\\\n20.4.2.10 the ball does not leave the bowler’s hand for any reason other than an attempt to run out the non-\\\\nstriker under clause 38.3 (Non-striker leaving his ground early). \\\\n20.4.2.11 satisfied that the ball in play cannot be recovered. \\\\n20.4.2.12 he/she considers that either side has been disadvantaged by a person, animal or other object within \\\\nthe field of play. However, if both umpires consider the ball would have reached the boundary \\\\nregardless of the intervention, the boundary should stand (see clause 19.2.4 – Identifying and \\\\nmarking the boundary). \\\\n20.4.2.13 the striker attempts to play the ball and no part of his/her person, whether grounded or raised, \\\\nremains within the pitch as defined in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch). \\\\n \\\\n32 \\\\n20.4.2.14 required to do so under any of the Playing Conditions not included above. \\\\n20.5 Ball ceases to be dead \\\\nThe ball ceases to be dead – that is, it comes into play – when the bowler starts his run-up or, if there is no run-up, \\\\nstarts his bowling action. \\\\n20.6 Dead ball not to be revoked \\\\nOnce the ball is dead, no revoking of any decision can bring the ball back into play for that delivery. \\\\n20.7 Dead ball; ball counting as one of over \\\\n20.7.1 When a ball which has been delivered is called dead or is to be considered dead then, other than as in \\\\nclause 20.7.2, \\\\n20.7.1.1 it will not count in the over if the striker has not had an opportunity to play it. \\\\n20.7.1.2 Unless No ball or Wide ball has been called, it will be a valid ball if the striker has had an \\\\nopportunity to play it, except in the circumstances of clauses 20.4.2.6 and 24.4 ( Player returning \\\\nwithout permission), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to distract striker) and 41.5 \\\\n(Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter). \\\\n20.7.2 In clause 20.4.2.5, the ball will not count in the over only if both conditions of not attempting to play the ball \\\\nand having an adequate reason for not being ready are met. Otherwise the delivery will be a valid ball. \\\\n21 NO BALL \\\\n21.1 Mode of delivery \\\\n21.1.1 The umpire shall ascertain whether the bowler intends to bowl right handed or left handed, over or round the \\\\nwicket, and shall so inform the striker. \\\\nIt is unfair if the bowler fails to notify the umpire of a change in his mode of delivery. In this case the umpire \\\\nshall call and signal No ball. \\\\n21.1.2 Underarm bowling shall not be permitted. \\\\n21.2 Fair delivery – the arm \\\\nFor a delivery to be fair in respect of the arm the ball must not be delivered with an Illegal Bowling Action. \\\\nAn Illegal Bowling Action is defined as a bowling action where a bowler’s Elbow Extension exceeds 15 degrees, \\\\nmeasured from the point at which the bowling arm reaches the horizontal until the point at which the ball is released \\\\n(any Elbow Hyperextension shall be discounted for the purposes of determining an Illegal Bowling Action). \\\\nShould either umpire or the ICC Match Referee suspect that a bowler has used an Illegal Bowling Action, they shall \\\\ncomplete the ICC Bowling Action Report Form at the conclusion of the match, as set out in the Illegal Bowling \\\\nRegulations. \\\\n21.3 Ball thrown or delivered underarm – action by umpires \\\\n21.3.1 If, in the opinion of either umpire, the ball has been thrown (where such mode of delivery does not \\\\ncorrespond to the bowler’s normal bowling action) or delivered underarm, he/she shall call and signal No ball \\\\nand, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- warn the bowler, indicating that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall apply to that bowler \\\\nthroughout the innings. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the batters at the wicket of what has occurred. \\\\n \\\\n33 \\\\n21.3.2 If either umpire considers that, in that innings, a further delivery by the same bowler is thrown (where such \\\\nmode of delivery does not correspond to the bowler’s normal bowling action) or delivered underarm, he/she \\\\nshall call and signal No ball and when the ball is dead inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling. The over shall, if \\\\napplicable, be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled the previous over or part thereof \\\\nnor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. The bowler thus suspended shall not bowl again in that \\\\ninnings. \\\\n- inform the batters at the wicket and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the reason for \\\\nthis action. \\\\n21.3.3 The umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the ICC Match \\\\nReferee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n21.4 Bowler throwing towards striker’s end before delivery \\\\nIf the bowler throws the ball towards the striker’s end before entering the delivery stride, it is not a No ball and the \\\\nprocedure stated in 21.3 shall not apply. However, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball under Clause 20.4.2.9. \\\\n21.5 Fair delivery – the feet \\\\nFor a delivery to be fair in respect of the feet, in the delivery stride \\\\n21.5.1 the bowler’s back foot must land within and not touching the return crease appertaining to his stated mode of \\\\ndelivery. \\\\n21.5.2 the bowler’s front foot must land with some part of the foot, whether grounded or raised \\\\n- on the same side of the imaginary line joining the two middle stumps as the return crease described in \\\\nclause 21.5.1, and \\\\n- behind the popping crease. \\\\nThe third umpire shall review television replays of the bowler’s feet landing and, if he/she is satisfied that not all the \\\\nrequirements have been met, advise the bowler’s end umpire who shall in turn immediately call and signal No ball. \\\\nSee clause 41.8 (Bowling of deliberate front foot No ball). \\\\nIn addition, if the third umpire, having reviewed television replays of the front foot landing, judges that the bowler’s \\\\nfront foot did not land with some part of the foot, whether grounded or raised, behind the popping crease, he/she shall \\\\nimmediately advise the bowler’s end umpire who shall in turn immediately call and signal No ball. \\\\n21.6 Bowler breaking wicket in delivering ball \\\\nEither umpire shall call and signal No ball if, other than in an attempt to run out the non-striker under clause 38.3 \\\\n(Non-striker leaving his/her ground early), the bowler breaks the wicket at any time after the ball comes into play and \\\\nbefore completion of the stride after the delivery stride. This shall include any clothing or other object that falls from \\\\nhis person and breaks the wicket. \\\\n21.7 Ball bouncing more than once, rolling along the ground or \\\\npitching off the pitch \\\\nThe umpire shall call and signal No ball if a ball which he/she considers to have been delivered, without having \\\\npreviously touched bat or person of the striker, \\\\n- bounces more than once \\\\n- or rolls along the ground before it reaches the popping crease. \\\\n- or pitches wholly or partially off the pitch as defined in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch) before it reaches the line of the \\\\nstriker’s wicket. \\\\n \\\\n34 \\\\n21.8 Ball causing the striker to leave the pitch or ball coming to \\\\nrest in front of striker’s wicket \\\\nIf a ball delivered by the bowler comes to rest in front of the line of the striker’s wicket, or is so far from the pitch that \\\\nthe striker would need to leave the pitch to attempt to play the ball (see clause 25.6 – Striker’s right to play the ball)  \\\\nwithout having previously touched the bat or person of the striker, the umpire shall call and signal No ball and \\\\nimmediately call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n21.9 Fielder intercepting a delivery \\\\nIf except in the circumstances of clause 27.3 (Position of wicket-keeper) a ball, delivered by the bowler, makes \\\\ncontact with any part of a fielder’s person before it either makes contact with the striker’s bat or person, or it passes \\\\nthe striker’s wicket, the umpire shall call and signal No ball and immediately call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n21.10 Ball bouncing over head height of striker \\\\nSee clauses 22.1.1.2 and 41.6.1.7. \\\\n21.11 Call of No ball for infringement of other clauses \\\\nIn addition to the instances above, No ball is to be called and signalled as required by the following: \\\\nClause 27.3 – Position of wicket-keeper  \\\\nClause 28.4 – Limitation of on side fielders \\\\nClause 28.5 – Fielders not to encroach on pitch \\\\nClause 41.6 – Bowling of dangerous and unfair short pitched deliveries \\\\nClause 41.7 – Bowling of dangerous and unfair non-pitching deliveries \\\\nClause 41.8 – Bowling of deliberate front foot No ball. \\\\n21.12 Revoking a call of No ball \\\\nAn umpire shall revoke the call of No ball if Dead ball is called under any of Laws 20.4.2.4, 20.4.2.5, 20.4.2.6, \\\\n20.4.2.8 or 20.4.2.10 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball). \\\\n21.13 No ball to over-ride Wide \\\\nA call of No ball shall over-ride the call of Wide ball at any time. See clauses 22.1 (Judging a Wide) and 22.2 (Call \\\\nand signal of Wide ball). \\\\n21.14 Ball not dead \\\\nThe ball does not become dead on the call of No ball. \\\\n21.15 Penalty for a No ball \\\\nA penalty of one run shall be awarded instantly on the call of No ball. Unless the call is revoked, the penalty shall \\\\nstand even if a batter is dismissed. It shall be in addition to any other runs scored, any boundary allowance and any \\\\nother runs awarded for penalties. \\\\n21.16 Runs resulting from a No ball – how scored \\\\nThe one run penalty shall be scored as a No ball extra and shall be debited against the bowler. If other Penalty runs \\\\nhave been awarded to either side these shall be scored as stated in clause 41.17 (Penalty runs). Any runs completed \\\\nby the batters or any boundary allowance shall be credited to the striker if the ball has been struck by the bat; \\\\notherwise they shall also be scored as Byes or Leg byes as appropriate. \\\\n21.17 No ball not to count \\\\nA No ball shall not count as one of the over. See clause 17.3 (Validity of balls). \\\\n \\\\n35 \\\\n21.18 Out from a No ball \\\\nWhen No ball has been called, neither batter shall be out under any of the Playing Conditions except clause 34 (Hit \\\\nthe ball twice), clause 37 (Obstructing the field) or clause 38 (Run out). \\\\n21.19 Free Hit  \\\\n21.19.1 In addition to the above, the delivery following a No ball called (all modes of No ball) shall be a free hit for \\\\nwhichever batter is facing it. If the delivery for the free hit is not a legitimate delivery (any kind of No ball or a \\\\nWide ball) then the next delivery will become a free hit for whichever batter is facing it.  \\\\n21.19.2 For any free hit, the striker can be dismissed only under the circumstances that apply for a No ball, even if \\\\nthe delivery for the free hit is called Wide.  \\\\n21.19.3 Neither field changes nor the exchange of individuals between fielding positions are permitted for free hit \\\\ndeliveries unless: \\\\n21.19.3.1 There is a change of striker (the provisions of clause 41.2 shall apply), or \\\\n21.19.3.2 The No Ball was the result of a fielding restriction breach, in which case the field may be changed to \\\\nthe extent of correcting the breach. \\\\n21.19.4 For clarity, the bowler can change his mode of delivery for the free hit delivery. In such circumstances clause \\\\n21.1 shall apply. \\\\n21.19.5 The umpires will signal a free hit by (after the normal No Ball signal) extending one arm straight upwards \\\\nand moving it in a circular motion. \\\\n22 WIDE BALL \\\\n22.1 Judging a Wide \\\\n22.1.1 If the bowler bowls a ball, not being a No ball, the umpire shall adjudge it a Wide if, according to the \\\\ndefinition in clause 22.1.2 \\\\n22.1.1.1 the ball passes wide of where the striker is standing and which also would have passed wide of the \\\\nstriker standing in a normal batting position. \\\\n22.1.1.2 the ball passes above the head height of the striker standing upright at the popping crease. \\\\n22.1.2 The ball will be considered as passing wide of the striker unless it is sufficiently within reach for him to be \\\\nable to hit it with the bat by means of a normal cricket stroke. \\\\n22.1.3 Umpires are instructed to apply very strict and consistent interpretation in regard to this clause in order to \\\\nprevent negative bowling wide of the wicket. \\\\n22.2 Call and signal of Wide ball \\\\nIf the umpire adjudges a delivery to be a Wide he/she shall call and signal Wide ball as soon as the ball passes the \\\\nstriker’s wicket. It shall, however, be considered to have been a Wide from the instant that the bowler entered his \\\\ndelivery stride, even though it cannot be called Wide until it passes the striker’s wicket. \\\\n22.3 Revoking a call of Wide ball \\\\n22.3.1 The umpire shall revoke the call of Wide ball if there is any contact between the ball and the striker’s bat or \\\\nperson before the ball comes into contact with any fielder. \\\\n22.3.2 The umpire shall revoke the call of Wide ball if a delivery is called a No ball. See clause 21.13 (No ball to \\\\nover-ride Wide). \\\\n \\\\n36 \\\\n22.4 Delivery not a Wide \\\\n22.4.1 The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide, if the striker, by moving, either causes the ball to \\\\npass wide of him, as defined in clause 22.1.2 or brings the ball sufficiently within reach to be able to hit it by \\\\nmeans of a normal cricket stroke. \\\\n22.4.2 The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide if the ball touches the striker’s bat or person, but \\\\nonly as the ball passes the striker. \\\\n22.5 Ball not dead \\\\nThe ball does not become dead on the call of Wide ball. \\\\n22.6 Penalty for a Wide \\\\nA penalty of one run shall be awarded instantly on the call of Wide ball. Unless the call is revoked, under clause 22.3, \\\\nthis penalty shall stand even if a batter is dismissed, and shall be in addition to any other runs scored, any boundary \\\\nallowance and any other runs awarded for penalties. \\\\n22.7 Runs resulting from a Wide – how scored \\\\nAll runs completed by the batters or a boundary allowance, together with the penalty for the Wide, shall be scored as \\\\nWide balls. Apart from any award of 5 Penalty runs, all runs resulting from a Wide shall be debited against the bowler. \\\\n22.8 Wide not to count \\\\nA Wide shall not count as one of the over. See clause 17.3 (Validity of balls). \\\\n22.9 Out from a Wide \\\\nWhen Wide ball has been called, neither batter shall be out under any of the Playing Conditions except clause 35 (Hit \\\\nwicket), clause 37 (Obstructing the field), clause 38 (Run out) or clause 39 (Stumped). \\\\n23 BYE AND LEG BYE \\\\n23.1 Byes \\\\nIf the ball, delivered by the bowler, not being a Wide, passes the striker without touching his bat or person, any runs \\\\ncompleted by the batters from that delivery, or a boundary allowance, shall be credited as Byes to the batting side. \\\\nAdditionally, if the delivery is a No ball, the one run penalty for such a delivery shall be incurred. \\\\n23.2 Leg byes \\\\n23.2.1 If a ball delivered by the bowler first strikes the person of the striker, runs shall be scored only if the umpire \\\\nis satisfied that the striker has \\\\neither attempted to play the ball with the bat \\\\nor tried to avoid being hit by the ball. \\\\n23.2.2 If the umpire is satisfied that either of these conditions has been met runs shall be scored as follows. \\\\n23.2.2.1 If there is \\\\neither no subsequent contact with the striker’s bat or person, or \\\\nonly inadvertent contact with the striker’s bat or person \\\\nany runs completed by the batters or a boundary allowance shall be credited to the striker in the \\\\ncase of subsequent contact with his bat but otherwise to the batting side as in clause 23.2.3. \\\\n23.2.2.2 If the striker wilfully makes a lawful second strike, clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once) \\\\nand clause 34.4 (Runs permitted from ball lawfully struck more than once) shall apply. \\\\n23.2.3 The runs in clause 23.2.2.1, unless credited to the striker, shall be scored as Leg byes. \\\\n \\\\n37 \\\\nAdditionally, if the delivery is a No ball, the one run penalty for the No ball shall be incurred. \\\\n23.3 Leg byes not to be awarded \\\\nIf in the circumstance of clause 23.2.1 the umpire considers that neither of the conditions therein has been met, then \\\\nLeg byes shall not be awarded. \\\\nIf the ball does not become dead for any other reason, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball as soon as the ball \\\\nreaches the boundary or at the completion of the first run. \\\\nThe umpire shall then: \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side; \\\\n- return any not out batter to his original end; \\\\n- signal No ball to the scorers if applicable; \\\\n- award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging \\\\nto the fielding side). \\\\n24 FIELDER’S ABSENCE; SUBSTITUTES \\\\n24.1 Substitute fielders \\\\n24.1.1 The umpires shall allow a substitute fielder \\\\n24.1.1.1 if they are satisfied that a fielder has been injured or become ill and that this occurred during the \\\\nmatch, or \\\\n24.1.1.2 for any other wholly acceptable reason. \\\\nIn all other circumstances, a substitute is not allowed. \\\\n24.1.2 A substitute shall not bowl or act as captain but may act as wicket-keeper only with the consent of the \\\\numpires. Note, however, clause 42.4.1. \\\\n24.1.3 A nominated player may bowl or field even though a substitute has previously acted for him, subject to 24.2 \\\\nand 24.3. \\\\n24.1.4 Squad members of the fielding or batting team who are not playing in the match and who are not acting as \\\\nsubstitute fielders shall be required to wear a team training bib whilst on the playing area (including the area \\\\nbetween the boundary and the perimeter fencing). \\\\n24.2 Fielder absent or leaving the field of play \\\\n24.2.1 A player going briefly outside the boundary while carrying out any duties as a fielder is not absent from the \\\\nfield of play nor, for the purposes of this clause, is he to be regarded as having left the field of play. \\\\n24.2.2 If a fielder fails to take the field at the start of play or at any later time, or leaves the field during play, \\\\n24.2.2.1 an umpire shall be informed of the reason for this absence. \\\\n24.2.2.2 he shall not thereafter come on to the field of play during a session of play without the consent of \\\\nthe umpire. See clause 24.4. The umpire shall give such consent as soon as it is practicable. \\\\n24.2.3 If a player is absent from the field for longer than 8 minutes, the following restrictions shall apply to their \\\\nfuture participation in the match: \\\\n24.2.3.1 The player shall not be permitted to bowl in the match until he has either been able to field, or his \\\\nteam has subsequently been batting, for the total length of playing time for which the player was \\\\nabsent (hereafter referred to as Penalty time). A player’s unexpired Penalty time shall be limited to a \\\\nmaximum of 120 minutes. If any unexpired Penalty time remains at the end of an innings, it is \\\\ncarried forward to the next and subsequent innings of the match. \\\\n \\\\n38 \\\\n24.2.3.2 The player shall not be permitted to bat in the match until his team’s batting innings has been in \\\\nprogress for the length of playing time that is equal to the unexpired Penalty time carried forward \\\\nfrom the previous innings. However, once his side has lost five wickets in its batting innings, he may \\\\nbat immediately. If any unexpired penalty time remains at the end of that batting innings, it is carried \\\\nforward to the next and subsequent innings of the match. \\\\n24.2.4 If the player leaves the field before having served all of his Penalty time, the balance is carried forward as \\\\nunserved Penalty time. \\\\n24.2.5 On any occasion of absence, the amount of playing time for which the player is off the field shall be added to \\\\nany Penalty time that remains unserved, subject to a maximum cumulative Penalty time of 120 minutes, and \\\\nthat player shall not bowl until all of his Penalty time has been served. \\\\n24.2.6 For the purposes of clauses 24.2.3.1 and 24.2.3.2, playing time shall comprise the time play is in progress \\\\nexcluding intervals, intervals between innings and official drinks intervals. For clarity, a player’s Penalty time \\\\nwill continue to expire after he is dismissed, for the remainder of his team’s batting innings. \\\\n24.2.7 If there is an unscheduled break in play, the stoppage time shall count as Penalty time served, provided that, \\\\n24.2.7.1 the fielder who was on the field of play at the start of the break either takes the field on the \\\\nresumption of play, or his side is now batting. \\\\n24.2.7.2 the fielder who was already off the field at the start of the break notifies an umpire in person as soon \\\\nas he is able to participate, and either takes the field on the resumption of play, or his side is now \\\\nbatting. Stoppage time before an umpire has been so notified shall not count towards unserved \\\\nPenalty time. \\\\n24.2.8 Any unserved Penalty time shall be carried forward into the next innings of the match, as applicable. \\\\n24.3 Penalty time not incurred \\\\nA nominated player’s absence will not incur Penalty time if, \\\\n24.3.1 he has suffered an external blow during the match and, as a result, has justifiably left the field or is unable to \\\\ntake the field. \\\\n24.3.2 in the opinion of the umpires, the player has been absent or has left the field for other wholly acceptable \\\\nreasons, which shall not include illness or internal injury. \\\\n24.3.3 the player is absent from the field for a period of 8 minutes or less. \\\\n24.4 Player returning without permission \\\\nIf a player comes on to the field of play in contravention of clause 24.2.2 and comes into contact with the ball while it \\\\nis in play, the ball shall immediately become dead. \\\\n- The umpires shall signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers, if applicable. \\\\n- The umpire shall award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\n- Runs completed by the batters shall be scored together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the \\\\ninstant of the offence. \\\\n- The ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n- The umpire shall inform the other umpire, the captain of the fielding side, the batters and, as soon as practicable, \\\\nthe captain of the batting side of the reason for this action. \\\\n \\\\n39 \\\\n25 BATTER’S INNINGS \\\\n25.1 Eligibility to act as a batter \\\\nOnly a nominated player may bat and, subject to clause 25.3, may do so even though a substitute fielder has \\\\npreviously acted for him. \\\\n25.2 Commencement of a batter’s innings \\\\nThe innings of the first two batters, and that of any new batter on the resumption of play after a call of Time, shall \\\\ncommence at the call of Play. At any other time, a batter’s innings shall be considered to have commenced when that \\\\nbatter first steps onto the field of play. \\\\n25.3 Restriction on batter commencing an innings \\\\n25.3.1 If a member of the batting side has unserved Penalty time, see clause 24.2.7, that player shall not be \\\\npermitted to bat until that Penalty time has been served. However, even if the unserved Penalty time has not \\\\nexpired, that player may bat after his side has lost 5 wickets. \\\\n25.3.2 A member of the batting side’s Penalty time is served during Playing time, in the event of an unscheduled \\\\nstoppage, the stoppage time after the batter notifies an umpire in person that he is able to participate shall \\\\ncount as Penalty time served. \\\\n25.3.3 If any unserved Penalty time remains at the end of a team’s innings, it shall be carried forward to the next \\\\ninnings of the match if appropriate. \\\\n25.4 Batter retiring \\\\n25.4.1 A batter may retire at any time during his innings when the ball is dead. The umpires, before allowing play to \\\\nproceed, shall be informed of the reason for a batter retiring. \\\\n25.4.2 If a batter retires because of illness, injury or any other unavoidable cause, that batter is entitled to resume \\\\nhis innings. If for any reason this does not happen, that batter is to be recorded as ‘Retired - not out’. \\\\n25.4.3 If a batter retires for any reason other than as in clause 25.4.2, the innings of that batter may be resumed \\\\nonly with the consent of the opposing captain. If for any reason his innings is not resumed, that batter is to \\\\nbe recorded as ‘Retired - out’. \\\\n25.4.4 If after retiring a batter resumes his innings, subject to the requirements of clauses 25.4.2 and 25.4.3, it shall \\\\nbe only at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of another batter. \\\\n25.5 Runners \\\\nRunners shall not be permitted. \\\\n25.6 Striker’s right to play the ball \\\\nThe striker has a right to play the ball, or to make a legitimate second strike, after it has been delivered, without \\\\ninterference from the wicket-keeper or any other fielder (see clause 27.5 – Restrictions on actions of wicket-keeper \\\\nand clause 27.6 – Interference with wicket-keeper by striker). \\\\nHowever, the striker may only attempt to play the ball if some of his/her bat or person, whether grounded or raised, \\\\nremains within the pitch, as defined in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch). Should no part of the striker’s bat or person remain \\\\nwithin the pitch, whilst the striker is playing the ball, either umpire shall immediately call and signal Dead ball.  \\\\n \\\\n26 PRACTICE ON THE FIELD \\\\n26.1 Practice on the pitch or the rest of the square \\\\n26.1.1 There shall not be any practice on the pitch at any time. \\\\n \\\\n40 \\\\n26.1.2 There shall not be any practice on the rest of the square at any time except with the approval of the umpires. \\\\n26.1.2.1 If approved by the umpires, the use of the square for practice on any day of any match will be \\\\nrestricted to any netted practice area or bowling strips specifically prepared on the edge of the \\\\nsquare for that purpose. \\\\n26.1.2.2 Bowling practice on the bowling strips referred to above shall also be permitted during the interval \\\\n(and change of innings if not the interval) unless the umpires consider that, in the prevailing \\\\nconditions of ground and weather, it will be detrimental to the surface of the square. \\\\n26.2 Practice on the outfield \\\\n26.2.1 On any day of the match, all forms of practice are permitted on the outfield \\\\n- before the start of play \\\\n- after the close of play, and \\\\n - during the interval or between innings \\\\nproviding the umpires are satisfied that such practice will not cause significant deterioration in the condition \\\\nof the outfield. \\\\n26.2.2 Between the call of Play and the call of Time, practice shall be permitted on the outfield, providing that all of \\\\nthe following conditions are met: \\\\n- only the fielders as defined in paragraph 7 of Appendix A participate in such practice. \\\\n- no ball other than the match ball is used for this practice. \\\\n- no bowling practice takes place in the area between the square and the boundary in a direction parallel to \\\\nthe match pitch. \\\\n- the umpires are satisfied that it will not contravene either of clauses 41.3 (The match ball changing its \\\\ncondition) or 41.9 (Time wasting by the fielding side). \\\\nBowling a ball, using a short run up to a player in the outfield is not to be regarded as bowling practice but \\\\nshall be subject to the other conditions in this clause. \\\\n26.3 Trial run-up \\\\nA bowler is permitted to have a trial run-up provided the umpire is satisfied that it will not contravene either of clauses \\\\n41.9 (Time wasting by the fielding side) or 41.12 (Fielder damaging the pitch). \\\\n26.4 Penalties for contravention \\\\nAll forms of practice are subject to the provisions of clauses 41.3 (The match ball – changing its condition), 41.9 \\\\n(Time wasting by the fielding side) and 41.12 (Fielder damaging the pitch). \\\\n26.4.1 If there is a contravention of any of the provisions of clause 26.1 or 26.2, the umpire shall \\\\n- warn the player that the practice is not permitted; \\\\n- inform the other umpire and, as soon as practicable, both captains of the reason for this action. \\\\n26.4.1.1 If the contravention is by a batter at the wicket, the umpire shall inform the other batter and each \\\\nincoming batter that the warning has been issued. The warning shall apply to the team of that player \\\\nthroughout the match. \\\\n26.4.2 If during the match there is any further contravention by any player of that team, the umpire shall \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side; \\\\n- inform the other umpire, the scorers and, as soon as practicable, both captains, and, if the contravention is \\\\nduring play, the batters at the wicket. \\\\n \\\\n41 \\\\n27 THE WICKET-KEEPER \\\\n27.1 Protective equipment \\\\nThe wicket-keeper is the only fielder permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards. If these are worn, they are to \\\\nbe regarded as part of his person for the purposes of clause 28.2 (Fielding the ball). If by the wicket-keeper’s actions \\\\nand positioning when the ball comes into play it is apparent to the umpires that he will not be able to carry out the \\\\nnormal duties of a wicket-keeper, he shall forfeit this right and also the right to be recognised as a wicket-keeper for \\\\nthe purposes of clauses 33.2 (A fair catch), 39 (Stumped), 28.1 (Protective equipment), 28.4 (Limitation of on-side \\\\nfielders) and 28.5 (Fielders not to encroach on pitch). \\\\n27.2 Gloves \\\\n27.2.1 If, as permitted under clause 27.1, the wicket-keeper wears gloves, they shall have no webbing between the \\\\nfingers except joining index finger and thumb, where webbing may be inserted as a means of support. \\\\n27.2.2 If used, the webbing shall be a single piece of non-stretch material which, although it may have facing \\\\nmaterial attached, shall have no reinforcements or tucks. \\\\n27.2.3 The top edge of the webbing shall not protrude beyond the straight line joining the top of the index finger to \\\\nthe top of the thumb and shall be taut when a hand wearing the glove has the thumb fully extended. See \\\\nparagraph 3 of Appendix B. \\\\n27.3 Position of wicket-keeper \\\\n27.3.1 The wicket-keeper shall remain wholly behind the wicket at the striker’s end from the moment the ball comes \\\\ninto play until a ball delivered by the bowler \\\\ntouches the bat or person of the striker, or \\\\npasses the wicket at the striker’s end, or \\\\nthe striker attempts a run. \\\\n27.3.2 In the event of the wicket-keeper contravening this clause, the striker’s end umpire shall call and signal No \\\\nball as soon as applicable after the delivery of the ball. \\\\n27.4 Movement by wicket-keeper \\\\n27.4.1 After the ball comes into play and before it reaches the striker, it is unfair if the wicket-keeper significantly \\\\nalters his position in relation to the striker’s wicket, except for the following: \\\\n27.4.1.1 movement of a few paces forward for a slower delivery, unless in so doing it brings him within reach \\\\nof the wicket. \\\\n27.4.1.2 lateral movement in response to the direction in which the ball has been delivered. \\\\n27.4.1.3 movement in response to the stroke that the striker is playing or that his actions suggest he intends \\\\nto play. However the provisions of clause 27.3 shall apply. \\\\n27.4.2 In the event of unfair movement by the wicket-keeper, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball and \\\\ninform the other umpire of the reason for doing so. The bowler’s end umpire shall then: \\\\n27.4.2.1 award the one-run penalty for Wide or No ball, if applicable  \\\\n27.4.2.2 award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side \\\\n27.4.2.3 inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\n27.4.2.4 inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the ICC \\\\nMatch Referee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the wicket-\\\\nkeeper concerned. \\\\n \\\\n42 \\\\n27.5 Restriction on actions of wicket-keeper \\\\nIf, in the opinion of either umpire, the wicket-keeper interferes with the striker’s right to play the ball and to guard his \\\\nwicket, clause 20.4.2.6 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball) shall apply. \\\\nIf, however, either umpire considers that the interference by the wicket-keeper was wilful, then clause 41.4 \\\\n(Deliberate attempt to distract striker) shall also apply. \\\\n27.6 Interference with wicket-keeper by striker \\\\nIf, in playing at the ball or in the legitimate defence of his wicket, the striker interferes with the wicket-keeper, he shall \\\\nnot be out except as provided for in clause 37.3 (Obstructing a ball from being caught). \\\\n28 THE FIELDER \\\\n28.1 Protective equipment \\\\nNo fielder other than the wicket-keeper shall be permitted to wear gloves or external leg guards. In addition, \\\\nprotection for the hand or fingers may be worn only with the consent of the umpires. \\\\n28.2 Fielding the ball \\\\n28.2.1 A fielder may field the ball with any part of his person (see paragraph 12 of Appendix A), except as in clause \\\\n28.2.1.2. However, he will be deemed to have fielded the ball illegally if, while the ball is in play he wilfully \\\\n28.2.1.1 uses anything other than part of his person to field the ball. \\\\n28.2.1.2 extends his clothing with his hands and uses this to field the ball. \\\\n28.2.1.3 discards a piece of clothing, equipment or any other object which subsequently makes contact with \\\\nthe ball. \\\\n28.2.2 It is not illegal fielding if the ball in play makes contact with a piece of clothing, equipment or any other object \\\\nwhich has accidentally fallen from the fielder’s person, or been dropped by an umpire. \\\\n28.2.3 If a fielder illegally fields the ball, the ball shall immediately become dead and \\\\n- the penalty for a No ball or a Wide shall stand. \\\\n- any runs completed by the batters shall be credited to the batting side, together with the run in progress if \\\\nthe batters had already crossed at the instant of the offence. \\\\n- the ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\nIn addition the umpire shall: \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\n- inform the other umpire and the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. \\\\n28.3 Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side \\\\n28.3.1 Protective helmets, when not in use by fielders, may not be placed on the ground, above the surface except \\\\nbehind the wicket-keeper and in line with both sets of stumps. \\\\n28.3.2 If the ball while in play strikes the protective helmet, placed as described in clause 28.3.1 the ball shall \\\\nimmediately become Dead and, unless 28.3.3. applies: \\\\nthe umpire shall signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers, if applicable \\\\nthe umpire shall award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side; \\\\n \\\\n43 \\\\n28.3.2.1 any runs completed by the batters before the ball strikes the protective helmet shall be scored, \\\\ntogether with the run in progress if the batters had already crossed at the instant of the ball striking \\\\nthe protective helmet. \\\\n28.3.3 If the ball while in play strikes  the protective helmet, placed as described in clause 28.3.1, and the \\\\ncircumstances of clause 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded) or clause 34 (Hit the ball twice) apply, the \\\\numpire shall: \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\\\n- return any not out batter to his original end \\\\n- signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers if applicable \\\\n- award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3.2. \\\\n28.4 Limitation of on side fielders \\\\n28.4.1 At the instant of delivery, there may not be more than 5 fielders on the leg side. \\\\n28.4.2 At the instant of the bowler’s delivery there shall not be more than two fielders, other than the wicket-keeper, \\\\nbehind the popping crease on the on side. A fielder will be considered to be behind the popping crease \\\\nunless the whole of his person whether grounded or in the air is in front of this line. \\\\n28.4.3 In the event of infringement of this clause by any fielder, the striker’s end umpire shall call and signal No \\\\nball. \\\\n28.5 Fielders not to encroach on pitch \\\\nWhile the ball is in play and until the ball has made contact with the striker’s bat or person, or has passed the striker’s \\\\nbat, no fielder, other than the bowler, may have any part of his person grounded on or extended over the pitch. \\\\nIn the event of infringement of this clause by any fielder other than the wicket-keeper, the bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\ncall and signal No ball as soon as possible after delivery of the ball. Note, however, clause 27.3 (Position of wicket-\\\\nkeeper). \\\\n28.6 Movement by any fielder other than the wicket-keeper \\\\n28.6.1 Any movement by any fielder, excluding the wicket-keeper, after the ball comes into play and before the ball \\\\nreaches the striker, is unfair except for the following: \\\\n28.6.1.1 minor adjustments to stance or position in relation to the striker’s wicket. \\\\n28.6.1.2 movement by any fielder, other than a close fielder, towards the striker or the striker’s wicket that \\\\ndoes not significantly alter the position of the fielder. \\\\n28.6.1.3 movement by any fielder in response to the stroke that the striker is playing or that his actions \\\\nsuggest he intends to play. \\\\n28.6.2 In all circumstances clause 28.4 (Limitation of on side fielders) shall apply. \\\\n28.6.3 In the event of such unfair movement, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball and inform the other \\\\numpire of the reason for doing so. The bowler’s end umpire shall then: \\\\n28.6.3.1 award the one-run penalty for Wide or No ball, if applicable  \\\\n28.6.3.2 award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side \\\\n28.6.3.3 inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\n28.6.3.4 inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has \\\\noccurred. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the ICC \\\\nMatch Referee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the fielder \\\\nconcerned. \\\\n \\\\n44 \\\\n28.6.4 Note also the provisions of clause 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to distract striker). See also clause 27.4 \\\\n(Movement by wicket-keeper). \\\\n28.7 Restrictions on the placement of fielders  \\\\n28.7.1 In addition to the restrictions contained in clause 28.4 above, further fielding restrictions shall apply to certain \\\\novers in each innings. The nature of such fielding restrictions and the overs during which they shall apply are \\\\nset out in the following paragraphs.  \\\\n28.7.2 The following fielding restrictions shall apply:  \\\\n28.7.2.1 Two semi-circles shall be drawn on the field of play. The semi-circles shall have as their centre the \\\\nmiddle stump at either end of the pitch. The radius of each of the semi-circles shall be 30 yards \\\\n(27.43 metres). The semi-circles shall be linked by two parallel straight lines drawn on the field. \\\\n(Refer to paragraph 2 of Appendix C). The fielding restriction areas should be marked by \\\\ncontinuous painted white lines or ‘dots’ at 5 yard (4.57 metres) intervals, each ‘dot’ to be covered by \\\\na white plastic or rubber (but not metal) disc measuring 7 inches (18 cm) in diameter.  \\\\n28.7.2.2 At the instant of delivery:  \\\\n28.7.2.2.1 Powerplay 1 - no more than two (2) fielders shall be permitted outside this fielding \\\\nrestriction area. In an innings of 50 overs, these are overs 1 to 10 inclusive.  \\\\n28.7.2.2.2 Powerplay 2 - no more than four (4) fielders shall be permitted outside this fielding \\\\nrestriction area. In an innings of 50 overs, these are overs 11 to 40 inclusive  \\\\n28.7.2.2.3 Powerplay 3 - no more than five (5) fielders shall be permitted outside this fielding \\\\nrestriction area. In an innings of 50 overs, these are overs 41 to 50 inclusive  \\\\n28.7.2.3 In circumstances when the number of overs of the batting team is reduced, the number of overs \\\\nwithin each phase of the innings shall be reduced in accordance with the table below. For the sake \\\\nof clarity, it should be noted that the table shall apply to both the 1st and 2nd innings of the match. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nInnings duration Powerplay 1 Powerplay 2 Powerplay 3 \\\\n20 4 12 4 \\\\n21 4 13 4 \\\\n22 5 13 4 \\\\n23 5 14 4 \\\\n24 5 14 5 \\\\n25 5 15 5 \\\\n26 5 16 5 \\\\n27 6 16 5 \\\\n28 6 17 5 \\\\n29 6 17 6 \\\\n30 6 18 6 \\\\n31 6 19 6 \\\\n32 7 19 6 \\\\n33 7 20 6 \\\\n34 7 20 7 \\\\n35 7 21 7 \\\\n36 7 22 7 \\\\n37 8 22 7 \\\\n38 8 23 7 \\\\n39 8 23 8 \\\\n40 8 24 8 \\\\n41 8 25 8 \\\\n42 9 25 8 \\\\n43 9 26 8 \\\\n44 9 26 9 \\\\n45 9 27 9 \\\\n \\\\n45 \\\\n46 9 28 9 \\\\n47 10 28 9 \\\\n48 10 29 9 \\\\n49 10 29 10 \\\\n \\\\n28.7.2.4 If play is interrupted during an innings and the table above applies, the Powerplay takes immediate \\\\neffect. For the avoidance of doubt this applies even if the interruption has occurred mid-over. \\\\nIllustrations: \\\\nA 50 over innings is interrupted after 8.3 overs and reduced to 32 overs. The new phases \\\\nare 7+19+6. Therefore the middle phase fielding restrictions take immediate effect when \\\\nplay resumes and last for a further 17.3 overs. The final phase begins after 26 overs have \\\\nbeen bowled. \\\\nA 40 over innings is interrupted after 18.5 overs and reduced to 22 overs. The new phases \\\\nare 5+13+4. When play resumes, the final phase fielding restrictions apply for the \\\\nremaining 3.1 overs. \\\\n28.7.2.5 At the commencement of the middle and final phases of an innings, the umpire shall signal such \\\\ncommencement to the scorers by rotating his arm in a large circle.  \\\\n28.7.2.6 The scoreboard shall indicate the current Powerplay in progress.  \\\\n28.7.2.7 In the event of an infringement of any of the above fielding restrictions, the square leg umpire shall \\\\ncall and signal No ball. \\\\n29 THE WICKET IS BROKEN \\\\n \\\\n29.1 Wicket put down \\\\nThe wicket is broken when at least one bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps, or one or more stumps \\\\nis removed from the ground. \\\\n29.2    Breaking the wicket fairly \\\\n29.2.1 The wicket is broken fairly if a bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps or a stump is \\\\nstruck out of the ground. \\\\n29.2.1.1 by the ball, \\\\n29.2.1.2 by the striker’s bat if held or by any part of the bat that he is holding, \\\\n29.2.1.3 for the purpose of this clause only, by the striker\\'s bat not in hand, or by any part of the bat \\\\nwhich has become detached, \\\\n29.2.1.4 by the striker’s person or by any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached from \\\\nhis person, \\\\n29.2.1.5 by a fielder with his hand or arm, providing that the ball is held in the hand or hands so \\\\nused, or in the hand of the arm so used. \\\\n29.2.1.6 The wicket is also broken fairly if a fielder strikes or pulls a stump out of the ground as in \\\\nclause 29.1.2.5. \\\\n29.2 2 The disturbance of a bail, whether temporary or not, shall not constitute its complete removal from the top of \\\\nthe stumps, but if a bail in falling lodges between two of the stumps this shall be regarded as complete removal. \\\\n29.3 One bail off \\\\nIf one bail is off, it shall be sufficient for the purpose of breaking the wicket to remove the remaining bail or to strike or \\\\npull any of the three stumps out of the ground, in any of the ways stated in clause 29.1. \\\\n \\\\n46 \\\\n29.4 Remaking wicket \\\\nIf a wicket is broken or put down while the ball is in play, it shall not be remade by an umpire until the ball is dead. \\\\nSee clause 20 (Dead ball). Any fielder may, however, while the ball is in play, \\\\n- replace a bail or bails on top of the stumps. \\\\n- put back one or more stumps into the ground where the wicket originally stood. \\\\n29.5 Dispensing with bails \\\\nIf the umpires have agreed to dispense with bails in accordance with clause 8.4 (Dispensing with bails), it is for the \\\\numpire concerned to decide whether or not the wicket has been broken. \\\\n29.5.1 After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been broken fairly if the umpire concerned is satisfied that \\\\nthe wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker’s bat, person or items of his clothing or equipment as described \\\\nin clauses 29.2.1.2, 29.2.1.3 or 29.2.1.4, or by a fielder in the manner described in clause 29.2.1.5. \\\\n29.5.2 If the wicket has already been broken or put down, clause 29.5.1 shall apply to any stump or stumps still in the \\\\nground. Any fielder may replace a stump or stumps, in accordance with clause 29.4, in order to have an opportunity \\\\nof breaking the wicket fairly. \\\\n30 BATTER OUT OF HIS GROUND \\\\n30.1 When out of his ground \\\\n30.1.1 A batter shall be considered to be out of his ground unless some part of his person or bat is grounded \\\\nbehind the popping crease at that end. \\\\n30.1.2 However, a batter shall not be considered to be out of his ground if, in running or diving towards his ground \\\\nand beyond, and having grounded some part of his person or bat beyond the popping crease, there is \\\\nsubsequent loss of contact between the ground and any part of his person or bat, or between the bat and \\\\nperson. \\\\n30.2 Which is a batter’s ground \\\\n30.2.1 If only one batter is within a ground, it is his ground and will remain so even if he is later joined there by the \\\\nother batter. \\\\n30.2.2 If both batters are in the same ground and one of them subsequently leaves it, the ground belongs to the \\\\nbatter who remains in it. \\\\n30.2.3 If there is no batter in either ground, then each ground belongs to whichever batter is nearer to it, or, if the \\\\nbatters are level, to whichever batter was nearer to it immediately prior to their drawing level. \\\\n30.2.4 If a ground belongs to one batter then the other ground belongs to the other batter, irrespective of his \\\\nposition. \\\\n30.3 Position of non-striker \\\\nThe non-striker, when standing at the bowler’s end, should be positioned on the opposite side of the wicket to that \\\\nfrom which the ball is being delivered, unless a request to do otherwise is granted by the umpire. \\\\n31 APPEALS \\\\n31.1 Umpire not to give batter out without an appeal \\\\nNeither umpire shall give a batter out, even though he may be out under these Playing Conditions, unless appealed \\\\nto by a fielder. This shall not debar a batter who is out under these Playing Conditions from leaving the wicket without \\\\nan appeal having been made. Note, however, the provisions of clause 31.7. \\\\n \\\\n47 \\\\n31.2 Batter dismissed \\\\nA batter is dismissed if he is \\\\neither given out by an umpire, on appeal \\\\nor out under these Playing Conditions and leaves the wicket as in clause 31.1. \\\\n31.3 Timing of appeals \\\\nFor an appeal to be valid, it must be made before the bowler begins his run-up or, if there is no run-up, his bowling \\\\naction to deliver the next ball, and before Time has been called. \\\\nThe call of Over does not invalidate an appeal made prior to the start of the following over, provided Time has not \\\\nbeen called. See clauses 12.2 (Call of Time) and 17.2 (Start of an over). \\\\n31.4 Appeal “How’s That?” \\\\nAn appeal “How’s That?” covers all ways of being out. \\\\nRefer also to Appendix D – DRS . \\\\n31.5 Answering appeals \\\\nThe striker’s end umpire shall answer all appeals arising out of any of clauses 35 (Hit wicket), 39 (Stumped) or 38 \\\\n(Run out) when this occurs at the wicket-keeper’s end. The bowler’s end umpire shall answer all other appeals. \\\\nWhen an appeal is made, each umpire shall answer on any matter that falls within his jurisdiction. \\\\nWhen a batter has been given Not out, either umpire may answer an appeal, made in accordance with clause 31.3, if \\\\nit is on a further matter and is within his jurisdiction. \\\\n31.6 Consultation by umpires \\\\nEach umpire shall answer appeals on matters within his/her own jurisdiction. If an umpire is doubtful about any point \\\\nthat the other umpire may have been in a better position to see, he/she shall consult the latter on this point of fact and \\\\nshall then give the decision. If, after consultation, there is still doubt remaining, the decision shall be Not out. \\\\n31.7 Batter leaving the wicket under a misapprehension \\\\nAn umpire shall intervene if satisfied that a batter, not having been given out, has left the wicket under a \\\\nmisapprehension of being out. The umpire intervening shall call and signal Dead ball to prevent any further action by \\\\nthe fielding side and shall recall the batter. \\\\nA batter may be recalled at any time up to the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery, unless it is \\\\nthe final wicket of the innings, in which case it should be up to the instant when the umpires leave the field. \\\\n31.8 Withdrawal of an appeal \\\\nThe captain of the fielding side may withdraw an appeal only after obtaining the consent of the umpire within whose \\\\njurisdiction the appeal falls. If such consent is given, the umpire concerned shall, if applicable, revoke the decision \\\\nand recall the batter. \\\\nThe withdrawal of an appeal must be before the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery or, if the \\\\ninnings has been completed, the instant when the umpires leave the field. \\\\n32 BOWLED \\\\n32.1 Out Bowled \\\\n32.1.1 The striker is out Bowled if his wicket is broken by a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a No ball, even if \\\\nit first touches the striker’s bat or person. \\\\n \\\\n48 \\\\n32.1.2 However, the striker shall not be out Bowled if before striking the wicket the ball has been in contact with any \\\\nother player or an umpire. The striker will, however, be subject to clauses 37 (Obstructing the field), 38 (Run \\\\nout) and 39 (Stumped). \\\\n32.2 Bowled to take precedence \\\\nThe striker is out Bowled if his wicket is broken as in clause 32.1, even though a decision against him for any other \\\\nmethod of dismissal would be justified. \\\\n33 CAUGHT \\\\n33.1 Out Caught \\\\nThe striker is out Caught if a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a No ball, touches his bat without having \\\\npreviously been in contact with any fielder, and is subsequently held by a fielder as a fair catch, as described in \\\\nclauses 33.2 and 33.3, before it touches the ground. \\\\n33.2 A fair catch \\\\n33.2.1 A catch will be fair only if, in every case \\\\neither the ball, at any time \\\\nor any fielder in contact with the ball, \\\\nis not grounded beyond the boundary before the catch is completed. Note clauses 19.4 (Ball grounded \\\\nbeyond the boundary) and 19.5 (Fielder grounded beyond the boundary). \\\\n33.2.2 Furthermore, a catch will be fair if any of the following conditions applies: \\\\n33.2.2.1 the ball is held in the hand or hands of a fielder, even if the hand holding the ball is touching the \\\\nground, or is hugged to the body, or lodges in the external protective equipment worn by a fielder, \\\\nor lodges accidentally in a fielder’s clothing. \\\\n33.2.2.2 a fielder catches the ball after it has been lawfully struck more than once by the striker, but only if it \\\\nhas not been grounded since it was first struck. See clause 34 (Hit the ball twice). \\\\n33.2.2.3 a fielder catches the ball after it has touched the wicket, an umpire, another fielder or the other \\\\nbatter. \\\\n33.2.2.4 a fielder catches the ball after it has crossed the boundary in the air, provided that the conditions in \\\\nclause 33.2.1 are met. \\\\n33.2.2.5 the ball is caught off an obstruction within the boundary that is not designated a boundary by the \\\\numpires. \\\\n33.3 Making a catch \\\\nThe act of making a catch shall start from the time when the ball first comes into contact with a fielder’s person and \\\\nshall end when a fielder obtains complete control over both the ball and his own movement. \\\\n33.4 No runs to be scored \\\\nIf the striker is dismissed Caught, runs from that delivery completed by the batters before the completion of the catch \\\\nshall not be scored but any runs for penalties awarded to either side shall stand. The non-striker shall return to his \\\\noriginal end.   See clause 18.11 Batter returning to original end. \\\\n33.5 Caught to take precedence \\\\nIf the criteria of clause 33.1 are met and the striker is not out Bowled, then he is out Caught, even though a decision \\\\nagainst either batter for another method of dismissal would be justified. \\\\n \\\\n49 \\\\n34 HIT THE BALL TWICE \\\\n34.1 Out Hit the ball twice \\\\n34.1.1 The striker is out Hit the ball twice if, while the ball is in play, it strikes any part of his person or is struck by \\\\nhis bat and, before the ball has been touched by a fielder, the striker wilfully strikes it again with his bat or \\\\nperson, other than a hand not holding the bat, except for the sole purpose of guarding his wicket. See clause \\\\n34.3 and clause 37 (Obstructing the field). \\\\n34.1.2 For the purpose of this clause ‘struck’ or ‘strike’ shall include contact with the person of the striker. \\\\n34.1.3  This clause will apply whether or not No ball is called. \\\\n34.2 Not out Hit the ball twice \\\\nThe striker will not be out under this clause if he \\\\n34.2.1 strikes the ball a second or subsequent time in order to return the ball to any fielder.  \\\\nNote, however, the provisions of clause 37.4 (Returning the ball to a fielder). \\\\n34.2.2 wilfully strikes the ball after it has touched a fielder. Note, however the provisions of clause 37.1 (Out \\\\nObstructing the field). \\\\n34.3 Ball lawfully struck more than once \\\\nThe striker may, solely in order to guard his wicket and before the ball has been touched by a fielder, lawfully strike \\\\nthe ball a second or subsequent time with the bat, or with any part of his person other than a hand not holding the \\\\nbat. The striker may guard his wicket even if the delivery is a No ball. \\\\nHowever, the striker may not prevent the ball from being caught by striking the ball more than once in defence of his \\\\nwicket. See clause 37.3 (Obstructing a ball from being caught). \\\\n34.4 Runs permitted from ball lawfully struck more than once \\\\nWhen the ball is lawfully struck more than once, as permitted in clause 34.3, if the ball does not become dead for any \\\\nreason, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball as soon as the ball reaches the boundary or at the completion of \\\\nthe first run. However, the umpire shall delay the call of Dead ball to allow the opportunity for a catch to be \\\\ncompleted. \\\\nThe umpire shall \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\\\n- return any not out batter to his original end \\\\n- signal No ball to the scorers if applicable, and \\\\n- award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging \\\\nto the fielding side). \\\\n34.5 Bowler does not get credit \\\\nThe bowler does not get credit for the wicket. \\\\n35 HIT WICKET \\\\n35.1 Out Hit wicket \\\\n35.1.1 The striker is out Hit wicket if, after the bowler has entered the delivery stride and while the ball is in play, his \\\\nwicket is  broken by either the striker’s bat or person as described in clauses 29.2.1.2 to 29.2.1.4 ( Breaking \\\\nthe wicket fairly) in any of the following circumstances: \\\\n \\\\n50 \\\\n35.1.1.1 in the course of any action taken by him in preparing to receive or in receiving a delivery, \\\\n35.1.1.2 in setting off for the first run immediately after playing or playing at the ball, \\\\n35.1.1.3 if no attempt is made to play the ball, in setting off for the first run, providing that in the opinion of \\\\nthe umpire this is immediately after the striker has had the opportunity of playing the ball, \\\\n35.1.1.4 in lawfully making a second or further stroke for the purpose of guarding his wicket within the \\\\nprovisions of clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once). \\\\n35.1.2 If the striker breaks his wicket  in any of the ways described in clauses 29.2.1.2 to 29.2.1.4 (Breaking the \\\\nwicket fairly) before the bowler has entered the delivery stride, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n35.2 Not out Hit wicket \\\\nThe striker is not out under this clause should his wicket be put down in any of the ways referred to in clause 35.1 if \\\\nany of the following applies: \\\\n- it occurs after the striker has completed any action in receiving the delivery, other than in clauses 35.1.1.2 to \\\\n35.1.1.4. \\\\n- it occurs when the striker is in the act of running, other than setting off immediately for the first run. \\\\n- it occurs when the striker is trying to avoid being run out or stumped. \\\\n- it occurs when the striker is trying to avoid a throw in at any time. \\\\n- the bowler after entering the delivery stride does not deliver the ball. In this case either umpire shall immediately call \\\\nand signal Dead ball. See clause 20.4 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball). \\\\n- the delivery is a No ball. \\\\n35.3 Runs scored \\\\nNo runs shall be scored when the striker is dismissed Hit wicket other than the one-run penalty for a Wide and any \\\\naward of 5 Penalty Runs. \\\\n36 LEG BEFORE WICKET \\\\n36.1 Out LBW \\\\nThe striker is out LBW if all the circumstances set out in clauses 36.1.1 to 36.1.5 apply. \\\\n36.1.1 The bowler delivers a ball, not being a No ball \\\\n36.1.2 the ball, if it is not intercepted full-pitch, pitches in line between wicket and wicket or on the off side of the \\\\nstriker’s wicket \\\\n36.1.3 the ball not having previously touched his bat, the striker intercepts the ball, either full-pitch or after pitching, \\\\nwith any part of his person \\\\n36.1.4 the point of impact, even if above the level of the bails, \\\\neither is between wicket and wicket \\\\nor if the striker has made no genuine attempt to play the ball with the bat, is \\\\nbetween wicket and wicket or outside the line of the off stump. \\\\n36.1.5 but for the interception, the ball would have hit the wicket. \\\\n36.2 Interception of the ball \\\\n36.2.1 In assessing points of impact in clauses 36.1.3, 36.1.4 and 36.1.5, only the first interception is to be \\\\nconsidered. \\\\n \\\\n51 \\\\n36.2.2 In assessing clause 36.1.3, if the bowler’s end umpire is not satisfied that the ball intercepted the batter’s \\\\nperson before it touched the bat, the batter shall be given Not out. \\\\n36.2.3 In assessing clause 36.1.5, it is to be assumed that the path of the ball before interception would have \\\\ncontinued after interception, irrespective of whether the ball might have pitched subsequently or not. \\\\n36.3 Off side of wicket \\\\nThe off side of the striker’s wicket shall be determined by the striker’s batting position at the moment the ball comes \\\\ninto play for that delivery. See paragraph 13 of Appendix A. \\\\n37 OBSTRUCTING THE FIELD \\\\n37.1 Out Obstructing the field \\\\n37.1.1 Either batter is out Obstructing the field if, except in the circumstances of clause 37.2, and while the ball is in \\\\nplay, he wilfully attempts to obstruct or distract the fielding side by word or action. See also clause 34 (Hit \\\\nthe ball twice). \\\\n37.1.2 The striker is out Obstructing the field if, except in the circumstances of clause 37.2, in the act of receiving a \\\\nball delivered by the bowler, he wilfully strikes the ball with a hand not holding the bat. This will apply \\\\nwhether it is the first strike or a second or subsequent strike. The act of receiving the ball shall extend both \\\\nto playing at the ball and to striking the ball more than once in defence of his wicket. \\\\n37.1.3 This clause will apply whether or not No ball is called. \\\\n37.1.4 For the avoidance of doubt, if an umpire feels that a batter, in running between the wickets, has significantly \\\\nchanged his direction without probable cause and thereby obstructed a fielder’s attempt to effect a run out, \\\\nthe batter should, on appeal, be given out, obstructing the field. It shall not be relevant whether a run out \\\\nwould have occurred or not. \\\\nIf the change of direction involves the batter crossing the pitch, clause 41.14 shall also apply. \\\\nSee also paragraph 2.2 of Appendix D. \\\\n37.2 Not out Obstructing the field \\\\nA batter shall not be out Obstructing the field if \\\\nobstruction or distraction is accidental, or \\\\nobstruction is in order to avoid injury, or \\\\nin the case of the striker, he makes a second or subsequent strike to guard his wicket lawfully as in clause 34.3 (Ball \\\\nlawfully struck more than once). However, see clause 37.3. \\\\n37.3 Obstructing a ball from being caught \\\\n37.3.1    If the delivery is not a No ball, the striker is out Obstructing the field if wilful obstruction or distraction by \\\\neither batter prevents the striker being out caught.    \\\\n37.3.2    Clause 37.3.1 shall apply even if an obstruction is caused by the striker in lawfully guarding his wicket under \\\\nthe provision of Clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once). \\\\n37.3.3    If an obstruction or distraction takes place from a No ball then the batter who caused the obstruction or \\\\ndistraction will be out Obstructing the field.  \\\\nHowever, the striker is not out if the obstruction of a catch occurs while defending his/her wicket from a No \\\\nball with a lawful second strike. \\\\n \\\\n52 \\\\n37.4 Returning the ball to a fielder \\\\nEither batter is out Obstructing the field if, at any time while the ball is in play and, without the consent of a fielder, he \\\\nuses the bat or any part of his person to return the ball to any fielder. \\\\n37.5 Runs scored \\\\nWhen either batter is dismissed Obstructing the field, \\\\n37.5.1 unless the obstruction or distraction prevents the striker being out caught, any runs completed by the batters \\\\nbefore the offence shall be scored, together with any one run Penalty for No ball or wide, or any other award \\\\nof 5 Penalty Runs to either side. See clauses 18.6 (Runs awarded for penalties) and 18.8 (Runs scored \\\\nwhen a batter is dismissed). \\\\n37.5.2 if the obstruction or distraction prevents the striker being out caught, any runs completed by the batters shall \\\\nnot be scored but any  award of 5 Penalty Runs to either side shall stand. Clause 18.11 (Batter returning to \\\\noriginal end) will apply. \\\\n37.6 Bowler does not get credit \\\\nThe bowler does not get credit for the wicket. \\\\n38 RUN OUT \\\\n38.1 Out Run out \\\\nEither batter is out Run out, except as in clause 38.2, if, at any time while the ball is in play, \\\\nhe is out of his ground \\\\nand his wicket is fairly broken by either the action of a fielder or \\\\nthe ball rebounding off a fielder’s person \\\\neven though No ball has been called, except in the circumstances of clause 38.2.2.2, and whether or not a run is \\\\nbeing attempted. \\\\n38.2 Batter not out Run out \\\\n38.2.1 A batter is not out Run out in the circumstances of clauses 38.2.1.1 or 38.2.1.2. \\\\n38.2.1.1 He has been within his ground and has subsequently left it to avoid injury, when the wicket is \\\\nbroken. \\\\nNote also the provisions of clause 30.1.2 (When out of his ground). \\\\n38.2.1.2 The ball delivered by the bowler has not made contact with a fielder, before the wicket is put down. \\\\n38.2.2 The striker is not out Run out in any of the circumstances in clauses 38.2.2.1 and 38.2.2.2. \\\\n38.2.2.1 He is out Stumped. See clause 39.1.2 (Out Stumped). \\\\n38.2.2.2 No ball has been called \\\\nand he is out of his ground not attempting a run \\\\nand the wicket is fairly broken by the wicket-keeper without the intervention of another fielder. \\\\n38.3 Non-striker leaving his/her ground early \\\\n38.3.1   If the non-striker is out of his/her ground at any time from the moment the ball comes into play \\\\nuntil the instant when the bowler would normally have been expected to  release the ball, the non -\\\\nstriker is liable to be Run out by the bowler attempting to run him/her out. In these circumstances, the \\\\nnon- striker will be out Run out if he/she is out of his/her ground when his/her wicket is broken  by the \\\\nbowler throwing the ball at the wicket or by the bowler’s hand holding the ball,  whether or not the ball \\\\n \\\\n53 \\\\nis subsequently delivered. \\\\n38.3.2 If the ball is not delivered, \\\\n- if there is an appeal, the umpire shall make his/her decision on the Run out.  \\\\n- if there is no appeal, or if the decision is not out, he/she shall call and signal \\\\nDead ball as soon as possible. \\\\n- the ball shall not count as one in the over. \\\\n38.3.3 If the ball is delivered and there is an appeal, \\\\n- the umpire shall make his/her decision on the Run out. \\\\n- if the non-striker is not dismissed, the ball remains in play and clause 21.6\\\\n (Bowler breaking wicket in delivering ball) shall apply. \\\\n-  if the non-striker is dismissed, the ball shall not count as one in the over. \\\\n \\\\n38.4 Which batter is out \\\\nThe batter out in the circumstances of clause 38.1 is the one whose ground is at the end where the wicket is put \\\\ndown. See clause 30.2 (Which is a batter’s ground). \\\\n38.5 Runs scored \\\\nIf either batter is dismissed Run out, the run in progress when the wicket is put down shall not be scored, but any \\\\nruns completed by the batters shall stand, together with any runs for penalties awarded to either side. See clauses \\\\n18.6 (Runs awarded for penalties) and 18.8 (Runs scored when a batter is dismissed). \\\\n38.6 Bowler does not get credit \\\\nThe bowler does not get credit for the wicket. \\\\n39 STUMPED \\\\n39.1 Out Stumped \\\\n39.1.1 The striker is out Stumped, except as in clause 39.3, if \\\\na ball which is delivered is not called No ball \\\\nand he is out of his ground, other than as in clause 39.3.1 \\\\nand he has not attempted a run \\\\nwhen his wicket is fairly broken by the wicket-keeper without the intervention of another fielder. Note, \\\\nhowever clause 27.3 (Position of wicket-keeper). \\\\n39.1.2 The striker is out Stumped if all the conditions of clause 39.1.1 are satisfied, even though a decision of Run \\\\nout would be justified. \\\\n39.2 Ball rebounding from wicket-keeper’s person \\\\nIf the wicket is broken by the ball, it shall be regarded as having been put down by the wicket-keeper if the ball \\\\nrebounds on to the stumps from any part of the wicket-keeper’s person or equipment or has been kicked or thrown on \\\\nto the stumps by the wicket-keeper. \\\\n39.3 Not out Stumped \\\\n39.3.1 The striker will not be out Stumped if, after having received the delivery, he has left his ground in order to \\\\navoid injury. \\\\n \\\\n54 \\\\n39.3.2 If the striker is not out Stumped he may, except in the circumstances of clause 38.2.2.2 (Batter not out run \\\\nout) be out Run out if the conditions of clause 38.1 (Out Run out) apply. \\\\n                                         39.4 Runs Scored \\\\nWhen a striker is dismissed Stumped from a Wide ball, the one-run penalty shall stand. Note clauses 12.9 \\\\n(Conclusion of match), 16.6 (Winning hit or extras) and 22.2 (Call and signal of Wide ball) mean that if the penalty for \\\\na Wide concludes the match, then a stumping is not possible, but the one-run penalty for the Wide remains. \\\\n \\\\n40 TIMED OUT \\\\n40.1 Out Timed out \\\\n40.1.1 After the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, the incoming batter must, unless Time has been called, \\\\nbe ready to receive the ball or for the other batter to be ready to receive the next ball within 2 minutes of the \\\\ndismissal or retirement. If this requirement is not met, the incoming batter will be out, Timed out. \\\\n40.1.2 In the event of an extended delay in which no batter comes to the wicket, the umpires shall adopt the \\\\nprocedure of clause 16.2 (ICC Match Referee awarding a match). For the purposes of that clause the start \\\\nof the action shall be taken as the expiry of the 2 minutes referred to above. \\\\n40.2 Bowler does not get credit \\\\nThe bowler does not get credit for the wicket. \\\\n41 UNFAIR PLAY \\\\n41.1 Fair and unfair play – responsibility of captains \\\\nThe captains are responsible for ensuring that play is conducted within the Spirit of Cricket, as well as within these \\\\nPlaying Conditions. \\\\n41.2 Fair and unfair play – responsibility of umpires \\\\n41.2.1 The umpires shall be the sole judges of fair and unfair play. If either umpire considers that any action by a \\\\nplayer, not covered by these Playing Conditions, is unfair, he/she shall call and signal Dead ball, if \\\\nappropriate, as soon as it becomes clear that the call will not disadvantage the non-offending side, and \\\\nreport the matter to the other umpire.  \\\\n41.2.1.1 If this is a first offence by that side, the bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- summon the offending player’s captain and issue a first and final warning which shall apply to all members of the \\\\nteam for the remainder of the match. \\\\n- warn the offending player’s captain that any further such offence by any member of his team shall result in the \\\\naward of 5 Penalty runs to the opposing team. \\\\n41.2.1.2 If this is a second or subsequent offence by that side the bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- summon the offending player’s captain and inform him that there has been a further such offence. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side. \\\\n41.2.1.3 The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the player concerned. \\\\n \\\\n55 \\\\n41.3 The match ball – changing its condition \\\\n41.3.1 The umpires shall make frequent and irregular inspections of the ball. In addition, they shall immediately \\\\ninspect the ball if they suspect anyone of attempting to change the condition of the ball, except as permitted \\\\nin clause 41.3.2. \\\\n41.3.2 It is an offence for any player to take any action which changes the condition of the ball. \\\\nExcept in carrying out his normal duties, a batter is not allowed to wilfully damage the ball other than, when \\\\nthe ball is in play, in striking it with the bat. See also clause 5.5 (Damage to the ball). \\\\nA fielder may, however: \\\\n41.3.2.1 polish the ball on his clothing provided that no artificial substance is used, that the only natural \\\\nsubstance used is sweat, and that such polishing wastes no time. \\\\n41.3.2.2 remove mud from the ball under the supervision of an umpire. \\\\n41.3.2.3 dry a wet ball on a piece of cloth that has been approved by the umpires. \\\\n41.3.3 The umpires shall consider the condition of the ball to have been unfairly changed if any action by any \\\\nplayer does not comply with the conditions in clause 41.3.2. \\\\n41.3.4 If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly changed by a member or \\\\nmembers of either side, or that its condition is inconsistent with the use it has received, they shall consider \\\\nthat there has been a contravention of this clause and decide together whether they can identify the \\\\nplayer(s) responsible for such conduct. \\\\n41.3.5 If it is possible to identify the player(s) responsible for changing the condition of the ball, the umpires shall: \\\\n41.3.5.1 Subject to clause 41.3.2 above, change the ball forthwith.  \\\\n41.3.5.1.1 If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly changed \\\\nby a member or members of the fielding side, the batter at the wicket shall choose the \\\\nreplacement ball from a selection of six other balls of various degrees of usage \\\\n(including a new ball) and of the same brand as the ball in use prior to the \\\\ncontravention. \\\\n41.3.5.1.2 If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly changed \\\\nby a member or members of the batting side, the umpires shall select and bring into \\\\nuse immediately, a ball which shall have wear comparable to that of the previous ball \\\\nimmediately prior to the contravention. \\\\n41.3.5.2 Additionally, the bowler’s end umpire shall: \\\\n41.3.5.2.1 award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side; \\\\n41.3.5.2.2 if appropriate, inform the batters at the wicket and the captain of the fielding side that \\\\nthe ball has been changed and the reason for their action; and \\\\n41.3.5.2.3 inform the captain of the batting side as soon as practicable of what has occurred. \\\\n41.3.5.3 The umpires shall then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such \\\\naction as is considered appropriate against the player(s) concerned. \\\\n41.3.6 If it is not possible to identify the player(s) responsible for changing the condition of the ball, the umpires \\\\nshall: \\\\n \\\\n56 \\\\n41.3.6.1 Change the ball forthwith. The umpires shall choose the replacement ball for one of similar wear \\\\nand of the same brand as the ball in use prior to the contravention; \\\\n41.3.6.2 The bowler’s end umpire shall issue the captain with a first and final warning, and \\\\n41.3.6.3 Advise the captain that should there be any further instances of changing the condition of the ball \\\\nby that team during the remainder of the series, clause 41.3.5.1.2 above will be adopted, with the \\\\ncaptain deemed to be the player responsible for the contravention. \\\\n41.4 Deliberate attempt to distract striker \\\\n41.4.1 It is unfair for any fielder deliberately to attempt to distract the striker while he is preparing to receive or \\\\nreceiving a delivery. \\\\n41.4.2 If either umpire considers that any action by a fielder is such an attempt, he/she shall immediately call and \\\\nsignal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. The bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side, the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting \\\\nside of the reason for the action. \\\\nNeither batter shall be dismissed from that delivery and the ball shall not count as one of the over. However, \\\\nif either umpire had reason to call and signal No ball, he/she shall do so regardless of the attempt to distract, \\\\nand this call shall stand \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the fielder concerned.  \\\\n41.5 Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter \\\\n41.5.1 In addition to clause 41.4, it is unfair for any fielder wilfully to attempt, by word or action, to distract, deceive \\\\nor obstruct either batter after the striker has received the ball. \\\\n41.5.2 It is for either one of the umpires to decide whether any distraction, deception or obstruction is wilful or not. \\\\n41.5.3 If either umpire considers that a fielder has caused or attempted to cause such a distraction, deception or \\\\nobstruction, he/she shall immediately call and signal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for \\\\nthe call. \\\\n41.5.4 Neither batter shall be dismissed from that delivery. \\\\n41.5.5 If an obstruction involves physical contact, the umpires together shall decide whether or not an offence \\\\nunder clause 42 (Players’ conduct) has been committed. \\\\n41.5.5.1 If an offence under clause 42 (Players’ conduct) has been committed, they shall apply the relevant \\\\nprocedures in clause 42 and shall also apply each of clauses 41.5.7 to 41.5.9. \\\\n41.5.5.2 If they consider that there has been no offence under clause 42 (Players’ conduct), they shall apply \\\\neach of clauses 41.5.6 to 41.5.10. \\\\n41.5.6 The bowler’s end umpire shall; \\\\n- Signal No ball or Wide to the scorers, if applicable. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action and as soon as practicable inform the \\\\ncaptain of the batting side. \\\\n41.5.7 The ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n41.5.8 Any runs completed by the batters before the offence shall be scored, together with any runs for penalties \\\\nawarded to either side. Additionally, the run in progress shall be scored whether or not the batters had \\\\nalready crossed at the instant of the offence. \\\\n \\\\n57 \\\\n41.5.9 The batters at the wicket shall decide which of them is to face the next delivery. \\\\n41.5.10 The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the fielder concerned. \\\\n41.6 Bowling of dangerous and unfair short pitched deliveries \\\\n41.6.1 Notwithstanding clause 41.6.2, the bowling of short pitched deliveries is dangerous if the bowler’s end \\\\numpire considers that, taking into consideration the skill of the striker, by their speed, length, height and \\\\ndirection they are likely to inflict physical injury on him. The fact that the striker is wearing protective \\\\nequipment shall be disregarded. \\\\nIn the first instance the umpire decides that the bowling of short pitched deliveries has become dangerous \\\\nunder clause 41.6.1 \\\\n41.6.1.1 The umpire shall call and signal No ball, and when the ball is dead, caution the bowler and inform \\\\nthe other umpire, the captain of the fielding side and the batters of what has occurred. This caution \\\\nshall apply to that bowler throughout the innings. \\\\n41.6.1.2 If there is a second instance, the umpire shall repeat the above procedure and indicate to the \\\\nbowler that this is a final warning, which shall apply to that bowler throughout the innings. \\\\n41.6.1.3 Should there be any further instance by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall \\\\n- call and signal No ball \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately \\\\nfrom bowling \\\\n- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any \\\\npart of the previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\n- The umpire shall inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting \\\\nside. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as \\\\nis considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.6.1.4 A bowler shall be limited to two fast short-pitched deliveries per over. \\\\n41.6.1.5 A fast short-pitched delivery is defined as a ball, which passes or would have passed above the \\\\nshoulder height of the striker standing upright at the popping crease. \\\\n41.6.1.6 The umpire at the bowler’s end shall advise the bowler and the batter on strike when each fast short \\\\npitched delivery has been bowled. \\\\n41.6.1.7 In addition, a ball that passes above head height of the batter, standing upright at the popping \\\\ncrease, that prevents him from being able to hit it with his bat by means of a normal cricket stroke \\\\nshall be called a Wide. See also clause 22.1.1.2 \\\\n41.6.1.7.1 For the avoidance of doubt any fast short pitched delivery that is called a Wide under this clause shall \\\\nalso count as one of the allowable short pitched deliveries in that over. \\\\n41.6.1.8 In the event of a bowler bowling more than two fast short-pitched deliveries in an over as defined in \\\\nclause 41.6.1.5 above, the umpire at the bowler’s end shall call and signal No ball on each \\\\noccasion. A differential signal shall be used to signify a fast short pitched delivery. The umpire shall \\\\ncall and signal ‘No ball’ and then tap the head with the other hand. \\\\n41.6.1.9 If a bowler delivers a third fast short pitched ball in an over, the umpire, after the call of No ball and \\\\nwhen the ball is dead, shall caution the bowler, inform the other umpire, the captain of the fielding \\\\nside and the batters at the wicket of what has occurred. This caution shall apply throughout the \\\\ninnings. \\\\n \\\\n58 \\\\n41.6.1.10 If there is a second instance of the bowler being No balled in the innings for bowling more than two \\\\nfast short pitched deliveries in an over, the umpire shall advise the bowler that this is his final \\\\nwarning for the innings. \\\\n41.6.1.11 Should there be any further instance by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall \\\\n- call and signal No ball \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately \\\\nfrom bowling \\\\n- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any \\\\npart of the previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\n- The umpire shall inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting \\\\nside. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as \\\\nis considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.6.2 Should the umpires initiate the caution and warning procedures set out in clauses 41.6.1.3 and 41.7 such \\\\ncautions and warnings are not to be cumulative. \\\\n41.7 Bowling of dangerous and unfair non-pitching deliveries \\\\n41.7.1 Any delivery, which passes or would have passed, without pitching, above waist height of the striker \\\\nstanding upright at the popping crease, is to be deemed to be unfair, whether or not it is likely to inflict \\\\nphysical injury on the striker. If the bowler bowls such a delivery the umpire shall immediately call and signal \\\\nNo ball. On a dismissal, the umpires may first consult or have the third umpire review the height of the \\\\ndelivery. \\\\nIf, in the opinion of the umpire, such a delivery is considered likely to inflict physical injury on the batter by its \\\\nspeed and direction, it shall be considered dangerous. When the ball is dead the umpire shall caution the \\\\nbowler, indicating that this is a first and final warning. The umpire shall also inform the other umpire, the \\\\ncaptain of the fielding side and the batters of what has occurred. This caution shall apply to that bowler \\\\nthroughout the innings. \\\\n41.7.2 Should there be any further instance (where a dangerous non-pitching delivery is bowled and is considered \\\\nlikely to inflict physical injury on the batter) by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall \\\\n- call and signal No ball \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from \\\\nbowling \\\\n- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the \\\\nprevious over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\nAdditionally the umpire shall \\\\n- report the occurrence to the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.7.3 The warning sequence in clauses 41.7.1 and 41.7.2 is independent of the warning and action sequence in \\\\nclause 41.6. \\\\n \\\\n59 \\\\n41.7.4 If the umpire considers that a bowler deliberately bowled a high full-pitched delivery, deemed to be \\\\ndangerous and unfair as defined in clause 41.7.1, then the caution and warning in clause 41.7.1 shall be \\\\ndispensed with. The umpire shall \\\\n- immediately call and signal No ball. \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from \\\\nbowling and inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the \\\\nprevious over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\n- report the occurrence to the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.8 Bowling of deliberate front-foot No ball \\\\nIf the umpire considers that the bowler has delivered a deliberate front-foot No ball, he/she shall \\\\n- immediately call and signal No ball. \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling \\\\n- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the previous \\\\nover, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\n- report the occurrence to the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.9 Time wasting by the fielding side \\\\n41.9.1 It is unfair for any fielder to waste time. \\\\n41.9.2 If either umpire considers that the progress of an over is unnecessarily slow, or time is being wasted in any \\\\nother way, by the captain of the fielding side or by any other fielder, at the first instance the umpire \\\\nconcerned shall \\\\n- if the ball is in play, call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of what has occurred. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- warn the captain of the fielding side, indicating that this is a first and final warning. \\\\n- inform the batters of what has occurred. \\\\n41.9.3 If either umpire considers that there is any further waste of time in that innings by any fielder, the umpire \\\\nconcerned shall \\\\n- if the ball is in play, call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of what has occurred. \\\\n \\\\n60 \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side and inform the captain of the \\\\nfielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\nAdditionally the umpire shall inform the batters and, as soon as is practicable, the captain of the batting side \\\\nof what has occurred. \\\\nIf the umpires believe that the act of time wasting was deliberate or repetitive, they may lodge a report under \\\\nthe ICC Code of Conduct. In such circumstances the Captain and/or any individual members of the fielding \\\\nteam responsible for the time wasting will be charged. \\\\n41.9.4   The fielding side shall be ready to start each over within 60 seconds of the previous over being completed. \\\\n \\\\nAn electronic clock will be displayed at the ground that counts down seconds from 60 to zero.   \\\\n \\\\nThe clock is not required or, if already started, can be cancelled if: \\\\n \\\\n- A new batter comes to the wicket between overs \\\\n- An official drinks interval has been called \\\\n- The umpires have approved the onfield treatment of an injury to a batter or fielder (see Appendix H) \\\\n- The time lost is for any circumstances beyond the control of the fielding side \\\\n \\\\nThe third umpire is responsible for determining when to start the clock.  This should be the later of: \\\\n \\\\n- The ball becoming dead at the end of the previous over \\\\n- Any umpire or player review from the final ball of the previous over being completed. \\\\n \\\\nWhen the clock reaches zero, if the fielding side is not ready to start the next over: \\\\n \\\\n- On the first such occasion in an innings, the bowler’s end umpire shall issue a warning to the captain of the \\\\nfielding side and inform the batters and the other umpire of what has occurred. \\\\n- On the second occasion in an innings, the above sequence is repeated, but with the reminder that this is a \\\\nfinal warning. \\\\n- On the third and any subsequent occasion in an innings, the bowler’s end umpire shall award 5 Penalty runs \\\\nto the batting side, informing the captain of the fielding side, the batters and the other umpire. \\\\n \\\\nThe process, warnings and penalties in 41.9.4 operate independently of those of 41.9.2 and 41.9.3.   \\\\n \\\\nIf a fielding side is ready to resume play within the required time, but the batting side are not ready to do so, \\\\nthen the umpires shall determine, at their discretion, whether to apply the provisions of 41.10 (Batter wasting \\\\ntime). \\\\n41.10 Batter wasting time \\\\n41.10.1 It is unfair for a batter to waste time. In normal circumstances, the striker should always be ready to take \\\\nstrike when the bowler is ready to start his run-up. \\\\nIn addition, an incoming batter should be in position to take guard or his partner ready to receive the next \\\\nball within 2 minutes of the fall of the previous wicket. \\\\n41.10.2 Should either batter waste time by failing to meet this requirement, or in any other way, the following \\\\nprocedure shall be adopted. At the first instance, either before the bowler starts his run-up or when the ball \\\\nbecomes dead, as appropriate, the umpire shall \\\\n- warn both batters and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall apply throughout the \\\\ninnings. The umpire shall so inform each incoming batter. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of what has occurred. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what \\\\nhas occurred. \\\\n \\\\n61 \\\\n41.10.3 If there is any further time wasting by any batter in that innings, the umpire shall, at the appropriate time \\\\nwhile the ball is dead \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the other batter, the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the \\\\nbatting side of what has occurred. \\\\nIf the umpires believe that the act of time wasting was deemed to be deliberate or repetitive, they may lodge \\\\na report under the ICC Code of Conduct. In such circumstances the batter concerned will be charged. \\\\n41.11 The protected area \\\\nThe protected area is defined as that area of the pitch contained within a rectangle bounded at each end by \\\\nimaginary lines parallel to the popping creases and 5 ft/1.52 m in front of each, and on the sides by imaginary lines, \\\\none each side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps, each parallel to it and 1 ft/30.48 cm \\\\nfrom it. \\\\n41.12 Fielder damaging the pitch \\\\n41.12.1 It is unfair to cause deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch. A fielder will be deemed to be causing \\\\navoidable damage if either umpire considers that his presence on the pitch is without reasonable cause. \\\\n41.12.2 If a fielder causes deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch, other than as in clause 41.13.1, at the first \\\\ninstance the umpire seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire. The \\\\nbowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- caution the captain of the fielding side and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall \\\\napply throughout the innings. \\\\n- inform the batters of what has occurred. \\\\n41.12.3 If, in that innings, there is any further instance of deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch, by any fielder, \\\\nthe umpire seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire. The bowler’s end \\\\numpire shall then \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\nAdditionally the umpire shall \\\\n- inform the fielding captain of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the fielder concerned. \\\\n41.13 Bowler running on protected area \\\\n41.13.1 It is unfair for a bowler to enter the protected area in his follow-through without reasonable cause, whether or \\\\nnot the ball is delivered. \\\\n41.13.2 If a bowler contravenes this clause, at the first instance and when the ball is dead, the umpire shall \\\\n- caution the bowler and inform the other umpire of what has occurred. This caution shall apply to that \\\\nbowler throughout the innings. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and the batters of what has occurred. \\\\n41.13.3 If, in that innings, the same bowler again contravenes this clause, the umpire shall repeat the above \\\\nprocedure indicating that this is a final warning. This warning shall also apply throughout the innings. \\\\n \\\\n62 \\\\n41.13.4 If, in that innings, the same bowler contravenes this clause a third time, when the ball is dead, the umpire \\\\nshall, \\\\n- direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling. If applicable, the \\\\nover shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the previous over, nor \\\\nbe allowed to bowl any part of the next over. The bowler taken off shall not be allowed to bowl again in that \\\\ninnings. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.14 Batter damaging the pitch \\\\n41.14.1 It is unfair to cause deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch. If the striker enters the protected area in \\\\nplaying or playing at the ball, he must move from it immediately thereafter. A batter will be deemed to be \\\\ncausing avoidable damage if either umpire considers that his presence on the pitch is without reasonable \\\\ncause. \\\\n41.14.2 If either batter causes deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch, other than as in clause 41.15, at the first \\\\ninstance the umpire seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the \\\\noccurrence. The bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- warn both batters that the practice is unfair and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning \\\\nshall apply throughout the innings. The umpire shall so inform each incoming batter. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what \\\\nhas occurred. \\\\n41.14.3 If there is any further instance of deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch by any batter in that innings, \\\\nthe umpire seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the occurrence. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\\\n- return any not out batter to his original end \\\\n- signal No ball or Wide to the scorers if applicable. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. \\\\n- award any other 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective \\\\nhelmets belonging to the fielding side). \\\\n- Inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the \\\\nreason for this action. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the batter concerned. \\\\n41.15 Striker in protected area \\\\n41.15.1 The striker shall not adopt a batting position in the protected area or so close to it that frequent \\\\nencroachment is inevitable. \\\\nThe striker may make a mark on the pitch for the purpose of indicating his/her batting position provided that \\\\nno mark is unreasonably close to the protected area. \\\\n \\\\n63 \\\\n41.15.2 If either umpire considers that the striker is in breach of any of the conditions in clause 41.15.1, if the bowler \\\\nhas not entered the delivery stride, he/she shall immediately call Dead ball, otherwise, wait until the ball is \\\\ndead; he/she shall then inform the other umpire of the occurrence. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- warn the striker that the practice is unfair and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning \\\\nshall apply throughout the innings. The umpire shall so inform the non-striker and each incoming batter. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what \\\\nhas occurred. \\\\n41.15.3 If there is any further breach of any of the conditions in clause 41.15.1 by any batter in that innings, the \\\\numpire seeing the contravention shall, if the bowler has not entered his delivery stride, immediately call and \\\\nsignal Dead ball, otherwise, he/she shall wait until the ball is dead and then inform the other umpire of the \\\\noccurrence. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\\\n- return any not out batter to his original end \\\\n- signal No ball or Wide to the scorers if applicable. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. \\\\n- award any other 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective \\\\nhelmets belonging to the fielding side). \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the \\\\nreason for this action. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the batter concerned. \\\\n41.16 Batters stealing a run \\\\n41.16.1 It is unfair for the batters to attempt to steal a run during the bowler’s run-up. \\\\nUnless the bowler attempts to run out the non-striker – see clause 38.3 (Non-striker leaving his/her ground \\\\nearly) – the umpire shall \\\\n- call and signal Dead ball as soon as the batters cross in such an attempt. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- return the batters to their original ends and disallow the attempted run. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. \\\\n-  award any other 5 run Penalty that is applicable \\\\n- inform the batters, the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting \\\\nside, of the reason for this action. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the batter concerned. \\\\n41.17 Penalty runs \\\\n41.17.1 When Penalty runs are awarded to either side, when the ball is dead the umpire shall signal the Penalty runs \\\\nto the scorers. See clause 2.13 (Signals). \\\\n \\\\n64 \\\\n41.17.2 Penalty runs shall be awarded in each case where these Playing Conditions require the award, even if a \\\\nresult has already been achieved. See clause 16.6 (Winning hit or extras). \\\\nNote, however, that the restrictions on awarding Penalty runs, in clauses 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded), \\\\n34.4 (Runs scored from ball lawfully struck more than once) and 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the \\\\nfielding side), will apply. \\\\n41.17.3 When 5 Penalty runs are awarded to the batting side under any of clauses 24.4 (Player returning without \\\\npermission), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side) or under 41.3, \\\\n41.4, 41.5, 41.9 or 41.12, then \\\\n- they shall be scored as Penalty extras and shall be in addition to any other penalties. \\\\n- they are awarded when the ball is dead and shall not be regarded as runs scored from either the \\\\nimmediately preceding delivery or the immediately following delivery, and shall be in addition to any runs \\\\nfrom those deliveries. \\\\n- the batters shall not change ends solely by reason of the 5 run penalty. \\\\n41.17.4 When 5 Penalty runs are awarded to the fielding side, under clause 18.5.2 (Deliberate short runs), or under \\\\n41.10, 41.14, 41.15 or 41.16, they shall be added as Penalty extras to that side’s total of runs in its most \\\\nrecently completed innings. If the fielding side has not completed an innings, the 5 Penalty runs shall be \\\\nadded to the score in its next innings. \\\\n42 PLAYERS’ CONDUCT \\\\n42.1 Serious misconduct \\\\n42.1.1 The umpires shall act upon any serious misconduct. The relevant offences and the corresponding actions by \\\\nthe umpires are identified in clause 42.2.1. These offences correspond with Level 4 offences in the ICC \\\\nCode of Conduct. Level 1 to Level 3 offences continue to be dealt with separately under the ICC Code of \\\\nConduct. \\\\n42.1.2 If either umpire considers that a player has committed one of these offences at any time during the match, \\\\nthe umpire concerned shall call and signal Dead ball. This call may be delayed until the umpire is satisfied \\\\nthat it will not disadvantage the non-offending side. \\\\n42.1.3 The umpire concerned shall report the matter to the other umpire and together they shall decide whether an \\\\noffence has been committed. The umpires may also consult with the third umpire and the match referee, \\\\nwho may review any audio or video replays to confirm whether an offence has been committed. If so, the \\\\numpires shall then apply the related sanctions. \\\\n42.1.4 Any call of No ball or Wide before the offence shall stand \\\\n42.1.5 If the offence is committed by a batter, the umpires shall summon the offending player’s captain to the field. \\\\nSolely for the purpose of this clause, the batters at the wicket may not deputise for their captain. \\\\n42.2 Level 4 offences and action by umpires \\\\n42.2.1 Any of the following actions by a player shall constitute a Level 4 offence: \\\\n- threatening to assault an umpire \\\\n- making inappropriate and deliberate physical contact with an umpire \\\\n- physically assaulting a player or any other person \\\\n- committing any other act of violence. \\\\n42.2.2 If such an offence is committed, 42.2.2.1 to 42.2.2.5 shall be implemented. \\\\n42.2.2.1 The umpire shall call Time. \\\\n \\\\n65 \\\\n42.2.2.2 Together the umpires shall summon and inform the offending player’s captain that an offence at this \\\\nLevel has occurred. \\\\n42.2.2.3 The umpires shall instruct the captain to remove the offending player immediately from the field of \\\\nplay for the remainder of the match and shall apply the following: \\\\n42.2.2.3.1 If the offending player is a fielder, no substitute shall be allowed for him. He is to be recorded as Retired \\\\n– out at the commencement of any subsequent innings in which his team is the batting side. \\\\n42.2.2.3.2 If a bowler is suspended mid-over, then that over must be completed by a different bowler, who shall not \\\\nhave bowled the previous over nor shall be permitted to bowl the next over. \\\\n42.2.2.3.3 If the offending player is a batter he is to be recorded as Retired – out in the current innings, unless he \\\\nhas been dismissed under any of clauses 32 to 39, and at the commencement of any subsequent \\\\ninnings in which his team is the batting side. If no further batter is available to bat, the innings is \\\\ncompleted. \\\\n42.2.2.4 As soon as practicable, the umpire shall: \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing team \\\\n- signal the Level 4 penalty to the scorers \\\\n- call Play. \\\\n42.2.2.5 The umpires shall then report the matter to the ICC Match Referee under the ICC Code of Conduct. \\\\n42.3 Captain refusing to remove a player from the field \\\\n42.3.1 If a captain refuses to carry out an instruction under 42.2.2.3, the umpires shall invoke clause 16.2 (ICC \\\\nMatch Referee awarding a match). \\\\n42.3.2 If both captains refuse to carry out instructions under 42.2.2.3 in respect of the same incident, the umpires \\\\nshall instruct the players to leave the field. The match is not concluded as in clause 12.6 and there shall be \\\\nno result under clause 16. \\\\n42.4 Additional points relating to Level 4 offences \\\\n42.4.1 If a player, while acting as wicket-keeper, commits a Level 4 offence, clause 24.1.2 shall not apply, meaning \\\\nthat only a nominated player may keep wicket, even if another fielder becomes injured or ill and is replaced \\\\nby a substitute. \\\\n42.4.2 A nominated player who has a substitute will also suffer the penalty for any Level 4 offence committed by \\\\nthe substitute. However, only the substitute will be reported under clause 42.2.2.5. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n66 \\\\nAppendices  \\\\n \\\\nA. Definitions \\\\nB. Equipment \\\\n1. The bat \\\\n2. The wickets \\\\n3.

For the purposes of \\\\ninterpreting these Playing Conditions, such a description will include \\\\nfaceguards head, neck and/or face grilles and neck guards. \\\\n2.4 Equipment – a batter’s equipment is his bat as defined above, together with \\\\nany external protective equipment he is wearing. \\\\nA fielder’s equipment is any external protective equipment that he is wearing. \\\\n2.5 The bat – the following are to be considered as part of the bat: \\\\n- the whole of the bat itself. \\\\n- the whole of a glove (or gloves) worn on the hand (or hands) holding the bat. \\\\n- the hand (or hands) holding the bat, if the batter is not wearing a glove on that hand or on those \\\\nhands. \\\\n2.6 Held in batter’s hand.  Contact between a batter’s hand, or glove worn on his \\\\nhand, and any part of the bat shall constitute the bat being held in that hand. \\\\n3 The playing area \\\\n3.1 The field of play is the area contained within the boundary. \\\\n3.2 The square is a specially prepared area of the field of play within which the \\\\nmatch pitch is situated. \\\\n3.3 The outfield is that part of the field of play between the square and the \\\\nboundary. \\\\n4 Positioning \\\\n4.1 Behind the popping crease at one end of the pitch is that area of the field of \\\\nplay, including any other marking, objects and persons therein, that is on that \\\\nside of the popping crease that does not include the creases at the opposite \\\\nend of the pitch.  Behind, in relation to any other marking, object or person, \\\\nfollows the same principle.  See the diagram in paragraph 13.  \\\\n4.2 In front of the popping crease at one end of the pitch is that area of the field \\\\nof play, including any other marking, objects and persons therein, that is on \\\\nthat side of the popping crease that includes the creases at the opposite end \\\\nof the pitch.  In front of, in relation to any other marking, object or person, \\\\nfollows the same principle.  See the diagram in paragraph 13. \\\\n4.3 The striker’s end is the place where the striker stands to receive a delivery \\\\nfrom the bowler only insofar as it identifies, independently of where the striker \\\\nmay subsequently move, one end of the pitch.  \\\\n4.4 The bowler’s end is the end from which the bowler delivers the ball.  It is the \\\\nother end of the pitch from the striker’s end and identifies that end of the pitch \\\\nthat is not the striker’s end as described in paragraph 4.3.  \\\\n4.5 The wicket-keeper’s end is the same as the striker’s end as described in \\\\nparagraph 4.3. \\\\n4.6 In front of the line of the striker’s wicket is in the area of the field of play in \\\\nfront of the imaginary line joining the fronts of the stumps at the striker’s end; \\\\n \\\\n69 \\\\nthis line to be considered extended in both directions to the boundary.  See \\\\nparagraph 4.2. \\\\n4.7 Behind the wicket is in the area of the field of play behind the imaginary line \\\\njoining the backs of the stumps at the appropriate end; this line to be \\\\nconsidered extended in both directions to the boundary. See paragraph 4.1. \\\\n4.8 Behind the wicket-keeper is behind the wicket at the striker’s end, as defined \\\\nabove, but in line with both sets of stumps and further from the stumps than \\\\nthe wicket-keeper. \\\\n4.9 Off side/on (leg) side – see diagram in paragraph 13 \\\\n4.10 Inside edge is the edge on the same side as the nearer wicket.  \\\\n5 Umpires and decision-making \\\\n5.1 Umpire – where the description the umpire is used on its own, it always \\\\nmeans ‘the bowler’s end umpire’ though this full description is sometimes used \\\\nfor emphasis or clarity.  Similarly the umpires always means both umpires \\\\nand the third umpire.  An umpire and umpires are generalised terms.  \\\\nOtherwise, a fuller description indicates which one of the umpires is \\\\nspecifically intended.  Each umpire will be bowler’s end umpire and striker’s \\\\nend umpire in alternate overs.  \\\\n5.2 Bowler’s end umpire is the umpire who is standing at the bowler’s end (see \\\\nparagraph 4.4) for the current delivery. \\\\n5.3 Striker’s end umpire is the umpire who is standing at the striker’s end (see \\\\nparagraph 4.3), to one side of the pitch or the other, depending on his/her \\\\nchoice, for the current delivery.     \\\\n5.4 On-field umpires shall mean, collectively, the bowler’s end umpire and the \\\\nstriker’s end umpire. \\\\n5.5 Third umpire is the umpire who may use television evidence and other \\\\navailable technology in order review a decision of the on-field umpires, either \\\\nby way of an Umpire Review or a Player Review under the protocol set out in \\\\nAppendix D. The third umpire shall also determine No balls under clause 21.5 \\\\n(Fair delivery – the feet). \\\\n5.6 Umpires together agree applies to decisions which the umpires are to make \\\\njointly, independently of the players. \\\\n5.7 Decision Review System or DRS is the process covered by the Decision \\\\nReview System and Third Umpire Protocol set out in Appendix D, under which \\\\nthe third umpire may be consulted in relation to a decision of the on-field \\\\numpires, either by way of an Umpire Review or a Player Review. \\\\n5.8 Player Review is the process set out in Appendix D by which a player may \\\\nrequest a review of any decision taken by the on-field umpires concerning \\\\nwhether or not a batter is dismissed (with the exception of ‘Timed out’). \\\\n5.9 Umpire Review is the process set out in Appendix D by which an on-field \\\\numpire has the discretion to refer a decision to the third umpire or, under \\\\ncertain circumstances, to consult with the third umpire before making a \\\\ndecision. \\\\n5.10 Soft Signal is the visual communication by the bowler’s end umpire to the \\\\nthird umpire (accompanied by additional information via two-way radio where \\\\nnecessary) of his/her initial on-field decision prior to initiating an Umpire \\\\nReview. \\\\n \\\\n70 \\\\n5.11 Umpire’s Call is the concept within the DRS under which the on-field decision \\\\nof the bowler’s end umpire shall stand, which shall apply under the specific \\\\ncircumstances set out in paragraphs 3.4.5 and 3.4.6 of Appendix D, where the \\\\nball-tracking technology indicates a marginal decision in respect of either the \\\\nImpact Zone or the Wicket Zone. \\\\n5.12 The Pitching Zone as used in the DRS is a two dimensional area on the pitch \\\\nbetween both sets of stumps with its boundaries consisting of the base of both \\\\nsets of stumps and a line between the outside of the outer stumps at each \\\\nend. \\\\n5.13 The Impact Zone as used in the DRS is a three dimensional space extending \\\\nbetween both sets of stumps to an indefinite height vertically and with its \\\\nboundaries consisting of the base of the stumps and the outside of the outer \\\\nstumps at each end. \\\\n5.14 The Wicket Zone as used in the DRS is a two dimensional area with its \\\\nboundaries consisting of the outside of the outer stumps, the base of the \\\\nstumps, and the top of the stumps. \\\\n5.15 A Fair Catch is a catch that has been taken cleanly by the fielder in \\\\naccordance with clause 33. \\\\n5.16 A Bump Ball is where the ball has made contact with the ground shortly after \\\\nmaking contact with the striker’s bat. \\\\n6 Batters \\\\n6.1 Batting side is the side currently batting, whether or not play is in progress. \\\\n6.2 Member of the batting side is one of the players nominated by the captain of \\\\nthe batting side, or any authorised replacement for such nominated player. \\\\n6.3 The Striker is the batter who receives the ball delivered by the bowler. \\\\n6.4 The non-striker is the batter who ground is at the bowler’s end when the ball \\\\nis delivered. \\\\n6.5 A batter’s ground – at each end of the pitch, the whole area of the field of \\\\nplay behind the popping crease is the ground at that end for a batter. \\\\n6.6 Original end is the end where a batter was when the ball came into play for \\\\nthat delivery. \\\\n6.7 Wicket he has left is the wicket at the end where a batter was at the start of \\\\nthe run in progress. \\\\n6.8  A batting position is the position and posture adopted by the striker to \\\\nreceive a ball delivered by the bowler \\\\n6.9 For the purposes of these Playing Conditions, waist height is defined as the \\\\npoint at which the top of the batter’s trousers would conventionally be when he \\\\nis standing upright at the popping crease. \\\\n7 Fielders \\\\n7.1 Fielding side is the side currently fielding, whether or not play is in progress. \\\\n7.2 Member of the fielding side is one of the players nominated by the captain of \\\\nthe fielding side, or any authorised replacement or substitute for such \\\\nnominated player.  \\\\n7.3 Fielder is one of the 11 or fewer players who together represent the fielding \\\\nside on the field of play. This definition includes not only both the bowler and \\\\n \\\\n71 \\\\nthe wicket-keeper but also nominated players who are legitimately on the field \\\\nof play, together with players legitimately acting as substitutes for absent \\\\nnominated players.  It excludes any nominated player who is absent from the \\\\nfield of play, or who has been absent from the field of play and who has not yet \\\\nobtained the umpire’s permission to return.  \\\\nA player going briefly outside the boundary in the course of discharging his duties as a fielder is not absent \\\\nfrom the field of play nor, for the purposes of clause 24.2 (Fielder absent or leaving the field of play), is he to \\\\nbe regarded as having left the field of play. \\\\n8 Substitutes and Concussion Replacements \\\\n8.1 A Substitute is a player who takes the place of a fielder on the field of play, \\\\nbut does not replace the player for whom he substitutes on that side’s list of \\\\nnominated players.  A substitute’s activities are limited to fielding. \\\\n8.2 A Concussion Replacement is a player who takes the place of a player who \\\\nhas been replaced in accordance with the process set out in clause 1.2.7, and \\\\nwho for the remainder of the match replaces that player on that side’s list of \\\\nnominated players, being able to take a full part in the match (subject to such \\\\nrestrictions as may be imposed by the ICC Match Referee in accordance with \\\\nclause 1.2.7.4) \\\\n8.3 A Concussion Replacement Request is the notification made to the ICC Match \\\\nReferee in accordance with the process set out in clause 1.2.7.3 \\\\n8.4 The Team Medical Representative is the individual designated as having \\\\nresponsibility for the assessment of any head or neck injury sustained by a \\\\nplayer as set out in clause 1.2.7.2 \\\\n9 Bowlers \\\\n9.1 Over the wicket / round the wicket – if, as the bowler runs up between the \\\\nwicket and the return crease, the wicket is on the same side as his bowling \\\\narm, he is bowling over the wicket.  If the return crease is on the same side as \\\\nhis bowling arm, he is bowling round the wicket. \\\\n9.2 Delivery swing is the motion of the bowler’s arm during which he normally \\\\nreleases the ball for a delivery. \\\\n9.3 Delivery stride is the stride during which the delivery swing is made, whether \\\\nthe ball is released or not.  It starts when the bowler’s back foot lands for that \\\\nstride and ends when the front foot lands in the same stride.  The stride after \\\\nthe delivery stride is completed when the next foot lands, i.e. when the back \\\\nfoot of the delivery stride lands again. \\\\n9.4 The Illegal Bowling Regulations are the ICC’s regulations governing Illegal \\\\nBowling Actions. \\\\n9.5 An Illegal Bowling Action is a bowling action where a bowler’s Elbow \\\\nExtension exceeds 15 degrees, measured from the point at which the bowling \\\\narm reaches the horizontal until the point at which the ball is released (any \\\\nElbow Hyperextension shall be discounted for the purposes of determining an \\\\nIllegal Bowling Action). \\\\n9.6 Elbow Extension means the motion that occurs when a bowler\\'s arm moves \\\\nfrom a flexed (bent) position at the elbow, to a more extended (straight) \\\\nposition (full Elbow Extension occurs when the arm is straight). \\\\n9.7 Elbow Hyperextension is the motion that occurs when a bowler\\'s elbow \\\\nextends beyond the straight position. \\\\n \\\\n72 \\\\n9.8 The ICC Bowling Action Report Form is the form provided for by Article 3 of \\\\nthe Illegal Bowling Regulations, by which an umpire and/or the ICC Match \\\\nReferee may submit a report relating to a suspected Illegal Bowling Action. \\\\n10 The ball \\\\n10.1 The ball is struck/strikes the ball unless specifically defined otherwise, \\\\nmean ‘the ball is struck by the bat’/‘strikes the ball with the bat’. \\\\n10.2 Full-pitch describes a ball delivered by the bowler that reaches or passes the \\\\nstriker without having touched the ground.  Sometimes described as non-\\\\npitching. \\\\n11 Runs \\\\n11.1 A run to be disallowed is one that in these Playing Conditions should not \\\\nhave been taken.  It is not only to be cancelled but the batters are to be \\\\nreturned to their original ends.   \\\\n11.2 A run not to be scored is one that is not illegal, but is not recognised as a \\\\nproperly executed run.  It is not a run that has been made, so the question of \\\\ncancellation does not arise.  The loss of the run so attempted is not a \\\\ndisallowance and the batters will not be returned to their original ends on that \\\\naccount.  \\\\n12 The person \\\\n12.1 Person; A player’s person is his physical person (flesh and blood) together \\\\nwith any clothing or legitimate external protective equipment that he is wearing \\\\nexcept, in the case of a batter, his bat. \\\\nA hand, whether gloved or not, that is not holding the bat is part of the batter’s person. \\\\nNo item of clothing or equipment is part of the player’s person unless it is attached to him. \\\\nFor a batter, a glove being held but not worn is part of his person. \\\\nFor a fielder, an item of clothing or equipment he is holding in his hand or hands is not part of his person. \\\\n12.2 Clothing – anything that a player is wearing, including such items as \\\\nspectacles or jewellery, that is not classed as external protective equipment is \\\\nclassed as clothing, even though he may be wearing some items of apparel, \\\\nwhich are not visible, for protection.  A bat being carried by a batter does not \\\\ncome within this definition of clothing. \\\\n12.3 Hand for batter or wicket-keeper shall include both the hand itself and the \\\\nwhole of a glove worn on the hand. \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n73 \\\\n13 Off side / on side; in front of / behind the popping crease. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n74 \\\\nAppendix B  \\\\n \\\\nEquipment  \\\\n1 The Bat \\\\n1.1 General guidance \\\\n1.1.1 Measurements - All provisions in paragraphs 1.2 to 1.6 below are subject to the measurements and \\\\nrestrictions stated in the Playing Conditions and this Appendix. \\\\n1.1.2 Adhesives – Throughout, adhesives are permitted only where essential and only in minimal quantity. \\\\n1.2 Specifications for the Handle \\\\n1.2.1 One end of the handle is inserted into a recess in the blade as a means of joining the handle and the blade. \\\\nThis lower portion is used purely for joining the blade and the handle together.  It is not part of the blade but, \\\\nsolely in interpreting paragraphs 1.3 and 1.4 below, references to the blade shall be considered to extend \\\\nalso to this lower portion of the handle where relevant. \\\\n1.2.2 The handle may be glued where necessary and bound with twine along the upper portion.  \\\\nProviding clause 5.5 is not contravened, the upper portion may be covered with materials solely to provide a \\\\nsurface suitable for gripping.  Such covering is an addition and is not part of the bat, except in relation to \\\\nclause 5.6.  The bottom of this grip should not extend below the point defined in paragraph 1.2.4 below. \\\\nTwine binding and the covering grip may extend beyond the junction of the upper and lower portions of the \\\\nhandle, to cover part of the shoulders of the bat as defined in paragraph 1.3.1. \\\\nNo material may be placed on or inserted into the lower portion of the handle other than as permitted above \\\\ntogether with the minimal adhesives or adhesive tape used solely for fixing these items, or for fixing the \\\\nhandle to the blade. \\\\n1.2.3 Materials in handle – As a proportion of the total volume of the handle, materials other than cane, wood or \\\\ntwine are restricted to one-tenth. Such materials must not project more than 3.25 in/8.26 cm into the lower \\\\nportion of the handle \\\\n1.2.4 Binding and covering of handle – The permitted continuation beyond the junction of the upper and lower \\\\nportions of the handle is restricted to a maximum, measured along the length of the handle, of \\\\n2.5 in/6.35 cm in for the twine binding \\\\n2.75 in/6.99 cm for the covering grip. \\\\n1.3 Specifications for the Blade \\\\n1.3.1 The blade has a face, a back, a toe, sides and shoulders \\\\n1.3.1.1 The face of the blade is its main striking surface and shall be flat or have a slight convex curve \\\\nresulting from traditional pressing techniques.  The back is the opposite surface. \\\\n1.3.1.2 The shoulders, sides and toe are the remaining surfaces, separating the face and the back. \\\\n1.3.1.3 The shoulders, one on each side of the handle, are along that portion of the blade between the first \\\\nentry point of the handle and the point at which the blade first reaches its full width. \\\\n1.3.1.4 The toe is the surface opposite to the shoulders taken as a pair. \\\\n1.3.1.5 The sides, one each side of the blade, are along the rest of the blade, between the toe and the \\\\nshoulders. \\\\n \\\\n75 \\\\n1.3.2 No material may be placed on or inserted into the blade other than as permitted in paragraph 1.2.4, \\\\nparagraph 1.3.3, and clause 5.4 together with the minimal adhesives or adhesive tape used solely for fixing \\\\nthese items, or for fixing the handle to the blade. \\\\n1.3.3 Covering the blade. Bats shall have no covering on the blade except as permitted in clause 5.4.   \\\\nAny materials referred to above, in clause 5.4 and paragraph 1.4 below, are to be considered as part of the \\\\nbat, which must still pass through the gauge as defined in paragraph 1.6. \\\\n1.4 Protection and repair  \\\\n1.4.1 The surface of the blade may be treated with non-solid materials to improve resistance to moisture \\\\npenetration and/or mask natural blemishes in the appearance of the wood.  Save for the purpose of giving a \\\\nhomogeneous appearance by masking natural blemishes, such treatment shall not materially alter the colour \\\\nof the blade.  \\\\n1.4.2 Materials can be used for protection and repair as stated in clause 5.4 and are additional to the blade. Note \\\\nhowever clause 5.6. \\\\nAny such material shall not extend over any part of the back of the blade except in the case of clause 5.4.1 \\\\nand then only when it is applied as a continuous wrapping covering the damaged area. \\\\nThe repair material shall not extend along the length of the blade more than 0.79 in/2.0 cm in each direction \\\\nbeyond the limits of the damaged area.  Where used as a continuous binding, any overlapping shall not \\\\nbreach the maximum of 0.04 in/0.1 cm in total thickness. \\\\nThe use of non-solid material which when dry forms a hard layer more than 0.004 in/0.01 cm in thickness is \\\\nnot permitted. \\\\n1.4.3 Permitted coverings, repair material and toe guards, not exceeding their specified thicknesses, may be \\\\nadditional to the dimensions above, but the bat must still pass through the gauge as described in paragraph \\\\n1.6. \\\\n1.5 Commercial identifications  \\\\nSuch identifications shall comply with the restrictions set out in the Clothing and Equipment Regulations in \\\\nrelation to the size and position of marks and logos. \\\\n1.6 Bat Gauge \\\\nAll bats must meet the specifications defined in clause 5.7. They must also, with or without protective \\\\ncoverings permitted in clause 5.4, be able to pass through a bat gauge, the dimensions and shape of which \\\\nare shown in the following diagram: \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n76 \\\\n2 The wickets \\\\n \\\\n2.1 Bails \\\\nOverall 4.31 in / 10.95 cm \\\\na = 1.38 in / 3.50 cm \\\\nb = 2.13 in / 5.40 cm \\\\nc = 0.81 in / 2.06 cm \\\\n2.2 Stumps \\\\nHeight (d) = 28 in / 71.1 cm \\\\nDiameter (e) - maximum = 1.5 in / 3.81 cm; minimum = 1.38 in / 3.50 cm \\\\n2.3 Overall \\\\nWidth (f) of wicket 9 in / 22.86 cm \\\\n3 Wicket-keeping gloves \\\\n3.1 The images below illustrate the requirements of clause 27.2 \\\\nin relation to: \\\\n• no webbing between the fingers; \\\\n• a single piece of non-stretch material between finger and thumb as a means of support; and \\\\n• when a hand wearing the glove has the thumb fully extended, the top edge being taut and not \\\\nprotruding beyond the straight line joining the top of the index finger to the top of the thumb. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n77 \\\\n  \\\\n3.2 Note also the requirement for wicket-keeping gloves to comply with the \\\\nClothing and Equipment Regulations in relation to the size and position of \\\\nmarks and logos. \\\\n4 Helmets and Neck Protectors \\\\n \\\\n4.1     Players must wear a helmet in the following circumstances where: \\\\n- batters are facing pace bowlers, \\\\n- wicket keepers are standing up to the stumps, and \\\\n- fielding close to the batter in front of the wicket \\\\n4.2     All helmets must be certified (BS7928:2013) helmets. \\\\n4.3     At other times helmets are optional.  However, if a helmet is worn, it also must be a certified  \\\\n(BS7928:2013) helmet. \\\\n4.4     The use of a neck protector when batting in International Cricket is optional. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n78 \\\\nAppendix C  \\\\n \\\\nThe Venue  \\\\n1 The pitch and the creases \\\\n \\\\n2 Restriction on the placement of fielders \\\\n \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n79 \\\\n3 Advertising on grounds, perimeter boards and sight-\\\\nscreens \\\\n3.1 Advertising on grounds \\\\n3.1.1 The logos on outfields are to be positioned as follows:   \\\\n(a) Behind the stumps – a minimum of 25.15 yards (23 meters) from the stumps.   \\\\n(b) Midwicket/cover area – no advertising to be positioned within 30 yards (27.50 meters) of the centre \\\\nof the pitch being used for the match.    \\\\n3.1.2 Note: Advertising closer to the stumps as set out above which is required to meet 3D requirements for \\\\nbroadcasters may be permitted, subject to prior ICC approval having been obtained.  \\\\n3.2 Perimeter boards \\\\n3.2.1 Advertising on perimeter boards placed in front of the sight-screens is permitted save that the predominant \\\\ncolour of such advertising shall be of a contrasting colour to that of the ball.  \\\\n3.2.2 Advertising on perimeter boards behind the stumps at both ends shall not contain moving, flashing or \\\\nflickering images and operators should ensure that the images are only changed or moved at a time that will \\\\nnot be distracting to the players or the umpires.    \\\\n3.2.3 The brightness of any electronic images shall be set at a level so that it is not a distraction to the players or \\\\numpires. \\\\n3.3 Sight-screens   \\\\n3.3.1 Sight-screens shall be provided at both ends of all grounds. \\\\n3.3.2 Advertising shall be permitted on the sight-screen behind the striker, providing it is removed for the \\\\nsubsequent over from that end. \\\\n3.3.3 Such advertising shall not contain flashing or flickering images and particular care should be taken by the \\\\noperators that the advertising is not changed at a time which is distracting to the umpire. \\\\n4 Markings on outfield \\\\nWith the permission of the Ground Authority, a bowler may use paint to make a small marking on the outfield \\\\nfor the purposes of identifying their run-up.

Otherwise, the third umpire shall be appointed and empowered to use \\\\nbroadcast replays to make decisions that are referred to him/her in accordance with paragraph 2 (Umpire \\\\nReviews). \\\\n1.1.5 The table below summarises the minimum requirements for DRS to be used, and the regulations around the \\\\nappointment of the third umpire: \\\\n  DRS \\\\nMinimum Requirement  Cameras \\\\n- Specification detailed in paragraph 1.1.2 Technology \\\\n- Approved ball-tracking technology. \\\\n- Approved sound-based edge detection technology. \\\\nThird Umpire Appointment  Appointed by the ICC. Not from the same country as either of the \\\\nparticipating teams. From ICC Elite Panel or International \\\\nPanel of umpires. \\\\n\\\\n \\\\n81 \\\\nThird Umpire Jurisdiction  Umpire Reviews and Player Reviews \\\\nReplays that can be used  Any replay, stump microphone audio or technology detailed in \\\\nparagraph 3.8.1 below. \\\\nICC Technical Officer  The ICC shall appoint an independent technology expert (ICC \\\\nTechnical Officer) to be present at every series in which the \\\\nDRS is used to assist the third umpire and to protect the \\\\nintegrity of the DRS process. \\\\n \\\\n82 \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n1.1.6 The ICC shall ensure that a separate room is provided for the third umpire and that he/she has access to the \\\\ntelevision equipment and technology  so as to be in the best position to facilitate the referral and/or \\\\nconsultation processes referred to in paragraphs 2 (Umpire Review) and 3 (Player Review) below. \\\\n2 Umpire Review \\\\nIn the circumstances detailed in paragraphs 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 below, the on-field umpire shall have the \\\\ndiscretion to refer the decision to the third umpire or, in the case of paragraphs 2.2, and 2.4, to consult with \\\\nthe third umpire before making the decision. In line with clause 21.5, the third umpire shall already have \\\\nreviewed television replays of the bowler’s feet landing and, where satisfied that not all the requirements \\\\nhave been met, shall immediately have advised the bowler’s end umpire (who shall in turn have immediately \\\\ncalled and signalled No ball). Accordingly, paragraphs 2 (Umpire Review) and 3 (Player Review) of this \\\\nAppendix D shall operate on the basis that this element of the referral and/or consultation process has \\\\nalready been undertaken. \\\\nSave for requesting the umpire to review his/her decision under paragraph 3 (Player Review) below, players \\\\nmay not appeal to the on-field umpires to use the Umpire Review. Breach of this provision may constitute \\\\ndissent and the player may be subject to disciplinary action under the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and \\\\nPlayer Support Personnel. \\\\n2.1 Run Out, Stumped, Bowled and Hit Wicket Decisions \\\\n2.1.1 The relevant on-field umpire shall be entitled to refer an appeal for run-out, stumped, bowled or hit wicket to \\\\nthe third umpire. \\\\n2.1.2 An on-field umpire wishing to refer a decision to the third umpire shall signal to the third umpire by making \\\\nthe shape of a TV screen with his/her hands. \\\\n2.1.3 In the case of a referral of a bowled, hit wicket or stumped decision, the third umpire shall first check the \\\\nfairness of the delivery (any mode of No ball on request except for (i) in respect of the feet, which shall \\\\nalready have been checked in accordance with clause 21.5; and (ii) the bowler using an Illegal Bowling \\\\nAction, subject to the proviso that the third umpire may review whether the bowler has used a prohibited \\\\nSpecific Variation under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations). If the delivery was not a fair delivery \\\\nthe third umpire shall indicate that the batter is Not out and advise the on-field umpire to signal No ball. See \\\\nalso paragraph 2.3.4 below. \\\\n2.1.4 Additionally, if on review of a run out, bowled or hit wicket, the third umpire finds the batter is Out by another \\\\nmode of dismissal (excluding LBW), or Not out by any mode of dismissal (excluding LBW), he/she shall \\\\nnotify the on-field umpire so that the correct decision is made. \\\\n2.1.5 If the third umpire decides that the batter is Out, a red light shall be displayed; if the third umpire decides that \\\\nthe batter is Not out, a green light shall be displayed. Should the third umpire be temporarily unable to \\\\nrespond, a white light (where available) shall remain illuminated throughout the period of interruption to \\\\nsignify to the on-field umpires that Umpire Reviews are temporarily unavailable, in which case the decision \\\\nshall be taken by the on-field umpire. As an alternative to the red/green light system, the replay screen \\\\n(where available) may be used for the purpose of conveying the third umpire’s decision, in line with the ICC \\\\nBig Screen Policy. \\\\n2.2 Caught Decisions, Obstructing the Field \\\\n2.2.1 Where the bowler’s end umpire is unable to decide upon a Fair Catch or a Bump Ball, or if, on appeal from \\\\nthe fielding side, the batter obstructed the field, he/she shall first consult with the striker’s end umpire. \\\\n2.2.2 Should both on-field umpires require assistance from the third umpire to make a decision, the bowler’s end \\\\numpire shall consult by two-way radio with the third umpire followed by making the shape of a TV screen \\\\nwith his/her hands.  \\\\n \\\\n83 \\\\n2.2.3 The third umpire shall determine whether the batter has been caught, whether the delivery was a Bump Ball, \\\\nor if the batter obstructed the field. However, in reviewing the television replay(s), the third umpire shall first \\\\ncheck the fairness of the delivery for all decisions involving a catch (any mode of No ball, on request, except \\\\nfor (i) in respect of the  feet, which shall already have been checked in accordance with clause 21.5; and (ii) \\\\nthe bowler using an Illegal Bowling Action, subject to the proviso that the third umpire may review whether \\\\nthe bowler has used a prohibited Specific Variation under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations) and \\\\nwhether the batter has hit the ball. If the delivery was not a fair delivery he/she shall advise the bowler’s end \\\\numpire to signal No ball. See also paragraph 2.6 below. Additionally, if it is clear to the third umpire that the \\\\nbatter is Out by another mode of dismissal (excluding LBW), or Not out by any mode of dismissal (excluding \\\\nLBW), he/she shall notify the bowler’s end umpire of his/her decision, which will then be displayed on the big \\\\nscreen. \\\\n2.2.4 The third umpire shall communicate his/her decision as set out in paragraph 2.1.5. \\\\n2.3 Boundary Decisions \\\\n2.3.1 The bowler’s end umpire shall be entitled to refer to the third umpire for a decision on: \\\\n2.3.1.1 whether a four or six has been scored; \\\\n2.3.1.2 whether a fielder had any part of his person in contact with the ball when he touched the boundary; \\\\nor \\\\n2.3.1.3 whether the fielder had any part of his person in contact with the ball when he had any part of his \\\\nperson grounded beyond the boundary. \\\\n2.3.1.4 the number of runs scored when a boundary results from an overthrow or the wilful act of a fielder \\\\n(see clause 19.8) \\\\n2.3.2 A decision shall be made immediately and cannot be changed thereafter. \\\\n2.3.3 If the television evidence is inconclusive as to whether or not a boundary has been scored, the default \\\\npresumption shall be in favour of no boundary being awarded. \\\\n2.3.4 Where the bowler’s end umpire wishes to use the assistance of the third umpire in this circumstance, he/she \\\\nshall communicate with the third umpire by use of a two-way radio and the third umpire shall convey his \\\\ndecision to the bowler’s end umpire by the same method. \\\\n2.3.5 The third umpire may initiate contact with the on-field umpire by two-way radio if TV coverage shows a \\\\nboundary line infringement or incident that appears not to have been acted upon by the on-field umpires. \\\\n2.4 Batters Running to the Same End \\\\n2.4.1 Where both batters have run to the same end and the on-field umpires are uncertain over which batter made \\\\nhis ground first, the on-field umpires may consult with the third umpire. \\\\n2.4.2 The procedure set out in paragraph 2.3.4 shall apply. \\\\n2.5 Short run \\\\n2.5.1 The third umpire shall automatically review any call of Short run by an on-field umpire under clauses 18.3 \\\\nand 18.4, communicating with the relevant on-field umpire by two-way radio and conveying his/her decision \\\\nby the same method. The on-field umpires may review any possible short run through the third umpire \\\\nwithout first calling the short run on-field. \\\\n2.6 No Balls \\\\n2.6.1 If the bowler’s end umpire is uncertain as to the fairness of the delivery following a dismissal (other than in \\\\nrespect of the  feet, which shall have already been checked by the third umpire), either affecting the validity \\\\nof the dismissal or which batter is dismissed, other than in respect of clause 21.5 (Fair delivery – the feet) for \\\\nwhich the third umpire will already have checked, he/she shall be entitled to request the batter to delay \\\\nleaving the field and to check the fairness of the delivery with the third umpire. Communication with the third \\\\numpire shall be by two-way radio. \\\\n \\\\n84 \\\\n2.6.2 The third umpire shall check any mode of No ball on request (other than in respect of the  feet, which shall \\\\nhave already been checked) not already checked except for the bowler using an Illegal Bowling Action \\\\n(subject to the proviso that the third umpire may review whether the bowler has used a prohibited Specific \\\\nVariation under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations).  \\\\n2.6.3 If the delivery was not a fair delivery, the bowler’s end umpire shall indicate that the batter is Not out and \\\\nsignal No ball (except in the case of a dismissal for obstructing the field, which may still be effected despite a \\\\nNo ball being called, in which case the bowler’s end umpire shall indicate that the relevant batter is Out and \\\\nadditionally call a No ball). \\\\n2.6.4 If a No ball under clause 21.5, after being reviewed by the third umpire, is only called by the bowler’s end \\\\numpire after the ball is dead,  the batting side shall benefit from the reversal of the dismissal and the one run \\\\nfor the No ball, but shall not benefit from any runs that may subsequently have accrued from the delivery \\\\nhad the on-field umpire originally called a No ball prior to the ball becoming dead. Where the batters crossed \\\\nwhile the ball was in the air before being caught, the batters shall return to their original ends as if the striker \\\\nhad been dismissed, but no runs shall be credited to the striker even if one (or more) runs were completed \\\\nprior to the catch being taken. \\\\n2.7 Cameras On or Over the Field of Play \\\\n2.7.1 The on-field umpires shall be entitled to refer to the third umpire for a decision as to whether the ball has at \\\\nany time during the normal course of play come into contact with any part of the camera, its apparatus or its \\\\ncables above the playing area, as contemplated in clause 20.1.3. \\\\n2.7.2 Where an on-field umpire wishes to use the assistance of the third umpire in this circumstance, he/she shall \\\\ncommunicate with the third umpire by use of a two-way radio and the third umpire shall convey his/her \\\\ndecision to the bowler’s end umpire by the same method. \\\\n2.7.3 A decision shall be made immediately and cannot be changed thereafter. If the television evidence is \\\\ninconclusive as to whether or not the ball has come into contact with any part of the camera, its apparatus or \\\\nits cables above the playing area, the default presumption shall be in favour of no contact having been \\\\nmade. \\\\n2.7.4 The third umpire may initiate contact with the on-field umpire by two-way radio if TV coverage shows the ball \\\\nto have been in contact with any part of the camera or its cables above the playing area as envisaged under \\\\nthis paragraph. \\\\n3 Player Review \\\\nThe following paragraphs shall operate in addition to and in conjunction with paragraph 2 (Umpire Review). \\\\n3.1 Circumstances in which a Player Review may be requested \\\\n3.1.1 A player may request a review of any decision taken by the on-field umpires concerning whether or not a \\\\nbatter is dismissed, with the exception of ‘Timed Out’ . A player may also request a review of any no ball \\\\ndecision taken by the on-field umpires concerning either a call or non-call of no ball, with the exception of the \\\\nbowler using an Illegal Bowling Action (Player Review). \\\\n3.1.2 No other decisions made by the umpires are eligible for a Player Review. \\\\n3.1.3 Only the batter involved in a dismissal may request a Player Review of an Out decision and only the captain \\\\n(or acting captain) of the fielding team may request a Player Review of a Not out decision. \\\\n3.1.4 A decision concerning whether or not a batter is dismissed that could have been the subject of a Umpire \\\\nReview under paragraph 2 is eligible for a Player Review as soon as it is clear that the on-field umpire has \\\\nchosen not to initiate the Umpire Review. \\\\n3.2 The manner of requesting the Player Review \\\\n3.2.1 The request shall be made by the player making a ‘T’ sign with both forearms at head height. \\\\n \\\\n85 \\\\n3.2.2 The total time elapsed between the ball becoming dead and the review request being made shall be no \\\\nmore than 15 seconds. The bowler’s end umpire shall provide the relevant player with a prompt after 10 \\\\nseconds if the request has not been made at that time and the player shall request the review immediately \\\\nthereafter. If the on-field umpires believe that a request has not been made within the 15 second time limit, \\\\nthey shall decline the request for a Player Review. \\\\n3.2.3 The captain may consult with the bowler and other fielders, and the two batters may consult with each other \\\\nprior to deciding whether to request a Player Review. Either the captain or the two batters may, in respect of \\\\na decision relating to an appeal for LBW, question the bowler’s end umpire as to whether his/her decision \\\\nhas been made on the basis that the striker made no genuine attempt to play the ball with the bat. Under no \\\\nother circumstances is any player permitted to query an umpire about any aspect of a decision before \\\\ndeciding on whether or not to request a Player Review. If the on-field umpires believe that the captain or \\\\neither batter has received direct or indirect input emanating other than from the players on the field, then \\\\nthey may at their discretion decline the request for a Player Review. In particular, signals from the dressing \\\\nroom must not be given. \\\\n3.2.4 No replays, either at normal speed or slow motion, shall be shown on a big screen to spectators until the 15 \\\\nsecond time limit allowed for requesting a Player Review has elapsed. \\\\n3.2.5 Where either on-field umpire initiates an Umpire Review, this does not preclude a player seeking a Player \\\\nReview of a separate incident from the same delivery. The request for a Player Review may be made after \\\\nthe Umpire Review, provided the request is still within the 15 second time limit described in paragraph 3.2.2 \\\\nabove. (See paragraphs 3.9.2 and 3.9.3 below for the process for addressing both an Umpire and Player \\\\nReview). \\\\n3.2.6 A request for a Player Review cannot be withdrawn once it has been made. \\\\n3.3 The process of consultation \\\\n3.3.1 On receipt of an eligible and timely request for a Player Review, the relevant on-field umpire shall make the \\\\nsign of a shape of a TV screen with his/her hands in the normal way. \\\\n3.3.2 The relevant on-field umpire shall initiate communication with the third umpire by confirming; \\\\n3.3.2.1 That a Player Review has been requested, \\\\n3.3.2.2 The mode of dismissal for which the relevant on-field umpire adjudicated the appeal, \\\\n3.3.2.3 The decision that has been made (Out or Not out), and; \\\\n3.3.2.4 For LBW appeals, where relevant, if the bowler’s end umpire believed that the striker made no \\\\ngenuine attempt to play the ball with the bat (the default presumption of the third umpire in the \\\\nabsence of any information on this point from the bowler’s end umpire shall be that a genuine \\\\nattempt to play the ball with the bat was made). \\\\n3.3.3 A two-way consultation process shall begin to investigate whether there is anything that the third umpire can \\\\nsee or hear which would indicate that the on-field umpire should change his/her original decision. \\\\n3.3.4 The third umpire shall not withhold any factual information which may help in the decision making process. \\\\nIn particular, in reviewing a dismissal, if the third umpire believes that the batter may instead be Out by any \\\\nother mode of dismissal, he/she shall advise the on-field umpire accordingly. The process of consultation \\\\ndescribed in this paragraph in respect of such other mode of dismissal shall then be conducted as if the \\\\nbatter has been given Not out. \\\\n3.3.5 The third umpire shall initially check all modes of No ball except for the bowler using an Illegal Bowling \\\\nAction (subject to the proviso that the third umpire may review whether the bowler has used a prohibited \\\\nSpecific Variation under Article 6.2 of the Illegal Bowling Regulations), where appropriate advising the on-\\\\nfield umpire accordingly. \\\\n3.3.6 If despite the available technology, the third umpire is unable to decide with a high degree of confidence \\\\nwhether the original on-field decision should be changed, then he/she shall report that the replays are \\\\n‘inconclusive’, and that the on-field decision shall stand. The third umpire shall not give answers conveying \\\\nlikelihoods or probabilities. \\\\n \\\\n86 \\\\n3.3.7 In circumstances where the television technology (all or parts thereof) is not available to the third umpire or \\\\nfails for whatever reason, the third umpire shall advise the on-field umpire of this fact but still provide any \\\\nrelevant factual information that may be ascertained from the available television replays and other \\\\ntechnology. \\\\n3.3.8 The on-field umpire shall then make his/her decision based on the information provided by the third umpire, \\\\nany other factual information offered by the third umpire and his/her recollection and opinion of the original \\\\nincident. \\\\n3.3.9 The on-field umpire shall reverse his/her decision if the nature of the supplementary information received \\\\nfrom the third umpire leads him/her to conclude that his/her original decision was incorrect. \\\\n3.4 Review of LBW Decisions \\\\n3.4.1 In assessing whether a batter is Out LBW in accordance with clause 36, the third umpire shall first judge \\\\nwhether the delivery is fair (as set out in clause 36.1.1), and second, whether or not the ball has touched the \\\\nbat before being intercepted by any part of the striker’s person (as set out in clause 36.1.3). \\\\n3.4.2 If the batter is still eligible to be Out, the ball-tracking technology shall then present three pieces of \\\\ninformation to the third umpire relating to the path of the ball: \\\\n3.4.2.1 The point of pitching (where applicable) (PITCHING) \\\\n3.4.2.2 The position of the ball at the point of first interception (IMPACT) \\\\n3.4.2.3 Whether the ball would have hit the wicket (WICKET) \\\\n3.4.3 This Decision Review System (DRS) and Third Umpire Protocol includes a category of Umpire’s Call, which \\\\nshall be the conclusion reported where the technology indicates a marginal decision in respect of either the \\\\npoint of first interception or whether the ball would have hit the stumps. \\\\n3.4.4 PITCHING \\\\n3.4.4.1 The interpretation of “pitches in line between wicket and wicket” in clause 36.1.2 shall refer to the \\\\nposition of the centre of the ball at the point of pitching, in relation to the Pitching Zone. \\\\n3.4.4.2 The Pitching Zone is defined as a two dimensional area on the pitch between both sets of stumps \\\\nwith its boundaries consisting of the base of both sets of stumps and a line between the outside of \\\\nthe outer stumps at each end. \\\\n3.4.4.3 Where applicable, the ball-tracking technology shall report that the ball pitched in one of the \\\\nfollowing three areas in relation to the Pitching Zone: \\\\nIn Line The centre of the ball was inside the Pitching Zone \\\\nOutside Off The centre of the ball was outside, and to the off side of, the Pitching \\\\nZone \\\\nOutside Leg The centre of the ball was outside, and to the leg side of, the Pitching \\\\nZone \\\\n \\\\n3.4.4.4 Subject to the satisfaction of the other elements of clause 36, the batter can be Out if the ball-\\\\ntracking technology reports that the ball pitched Outside Off or In Line, but the batter shall be Not \\\\nout if the ball pitched Outside Leg. \\\\n3.4.5 IMPACT \\\\n3.4.5.1 The interpretation of “the (first) point of impact, even if in above the level of the bails, is between \\\\nwicket and wicket” in clause 36.1.4 shall refer to the position of the ball at the point of first \\\\ninterception, in relation to the Impact Zone. \\\\n \\\\n87 \\\\n3.4.5.2 The Impact Zone is defined as a three dimensional space extending between both wickets to an \\\\nindefinite height and with its boundaries consisting of a line between the outside of the outer stumps \\\\nat each end. \\\\n3.4.5.3 The ball-tracking technology shall report that the point of first interception was in one of the \\\\nfollowing categories in relation to the Impact Zone: \\\\nIn Line The centre of the ball was inside the Impact Zone \\\\nUmpire’s Call Some part of the ball was inside the Impact Zone, but the centre of the \\\\nball was outside the Impact Zone, with the further sub-category of \\\\n‘Umpire’s Call (off side)’ where the centre of the ball was to the off side \\\\nof the Impact Zone and the bowler’s end umpire communicates to the \\\\nthird umpire that no genuine attempt to play the ball was made by the \\\\nbatter. \\\\nOutside No part of the ball was inside the Impact Zone, with the further sub-\\\\ncategories of ‘Outside (off)’ and ‘Outside (leg)’ to indicate the location \\\\nof the point of first interception in relation to the Impact Zone when the \\\\nbowler’s end umpire communicates to the third umpire that no genuine \\\\nattempt to play the ball was made by the batter. \\\\n \\\\n3.4.5.4 Where a Not out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batter has made a genuine \\\\nattempt to play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of first interception \\\\nwas In Line for the batter to be eligible to be given Out, otherwise the batter shall remain Not out. \\\\n3.4.5.5 Where a Not out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batter has made no genuine \\\\nattempt to play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of impact was In Line, \\\\nor Umpire’s Call (off side), or Outside (off) for the batter to be eligible to be given Out, otherwise the \\\\nbatter shall remain Not out. \\\\n3.4.5.6 Where an Out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batter has made a genuine \\\\nattempt to play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of first interception \\\\nwas Outside for the decision to be reversed to Not out, otherwise the batter shall remain eligible to \\\\nbe given Out. \\\\n3.4.5.7 Where an Out decision is being reviewed, and it is judged that the batter has made no genuine \\\\nattempt to play the ball, the ball-tracking technology must report that the point of first interception \\\\nwas Outside (leg) for the decision to be reversed to Not out, otherwise the batter shall remain \\\\neligible to be given Out. \\\\n3.4.6 WICKET \\\\n3.4.6.1 The interpretation of whether “the ball would have hit the wicket” in clause 36.1.5 shall refer to \\\\nposition of the ball as it either hits or passes the wicket, in relation to the Wicket Zone. \\\\n3.4.6.2 The Wicket Zone is defined as a two dimensional area whose boundaries are the outside of the \\\\nouter stumps, the base of the stumps and the top of the stumps. \\\\n3.4.6.3 The ball-tracking technology shall report whether the ball would have hit the wicket with reference to \\\\nthe following three categories: \\\\nHitting The ball was hitting the wicket, and the centre of the ball was inside \\\\nthe Wicket Zone \\\\nUmpire’s Call The ball was hitting the wicket, but the centre of the ball was not inside \\\\nthe Wicket Zone \\\\nMissing The ball was missing the wicket \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n88 \\\\n3.4.6.4 Where a Not out decision is being reviewed, the ball-tracking technology must report that the ball \\\\nwas Hitting for the batter to be eligible to be given Out, otherwise the batter shall remain Not out. \\\\nHowever, where the evidence shows that the ball was Hitting, the point of first interception was \\\\nIn Line, and the ball pitched In Line or Outside Off, but that: \\\\n• The point of first interception was 300cm or more from the stumps; or \\\\n• The point of first interception was more than 250cm but less than 300cm from the stumps \\\\nand the distance between the point of pitching and the point of first interception was less \\\\nthan 40cm, \\\\nthe on-field decision shall stand (that is, Not out). \\\\n3.4.6.5 Where an Out decision is being reviewed, the ball-tracking technology must report that the ball was \\\\nMissing for the on-field decision to be reversed to Not out, otherwise the batter shall remain eligible \\\\nto be given Out. \\\\n3.4.7 When the ball strikes the batter on the full, and the evidence provided by the ball-tracking technology \\\\nindicates that the ball would have pitched before striking or passing the wicket, there will be no information \\\\navailable from that delivery that will allow the ball-tracking technology to accurately predict the height of the \\\\nball after pitching. \\\\n3.4.8 With regard to determining whether the ball would have hit the wicket under these circumstances, the ball-\\\\ntracking technology shall project the line of the ball in accordance with clause 36.2.3 (it is to be assumed \\\\nthat the path of the ball before interception would have continued after interception, irrespective of whether \\\\nthe ball might have pitched subsequently or not), and display the simulated path of the ball from directly \\\\nabove the wicket. \\\\n3.4.9 The third umpire shall advise the bowler’s end umpire only on the point of first interception and whether the \\\\nball would have hit the stumps (in line with the process set out in paragraph 3.4 above), but shall make no \\\\ncomment on the predicted height of the ball after pitching, which shall remain a judgment of the bowler’s end \\\\numpire. \\\\n3.5 The process for communicating the final decision \\\\n3.5.1 For Player Reviews concerning potential dismissals, the relevant on-field umpire shall indicate Out by raising \\\\nhis/her finger above his/her head in a normal yet prominent manner or indicate Not out by the call of ‘not out’ \\\\nand by crossing his/her hands in a horizontal position side to side in front and above his/her waist three \\\\ntimes. Where the decision is a reversal of the on-field umpire’s previous decision, he/she shall make the \\\\n‘revoke last signal’ indication immediately prior to the above. \\\\n3.5.2 If the mode of dismissal is not obvious or not the same as that on which the original decision was based, \\\\nthen the umpire shall advise the scorers via the third umpire. \\\\n3.6 Number of Player Review requests permitted \\\\n3.6.1 In each innings, each team shall be allowed to make a maximum of two Player Review requests that are \\\\ncategorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ (as set out in paragraph 3.6.3 below). \\\\n3.6.2 Where a request for a Player Review results in the original on-field decision being reversed, then the Player \\\\nReview shall be categorised as ‘Successful’ and shall not count towards the innings limit. \\\\n3.6.3 Where a request for a Player Review results in the original on-field decision remaining unchanged (other \\\\nthan in the circumstances set out in paragraphs 3.6.4, 3.6.6 or 3.6.8), the Player Review shall be \\\\ncategorised as ’Unsuccessful’. \\\\n3.6.4 Where a request for a Player Review of an LBW decision results in the on-field decision remaining \\\\nunchanged solely on the basis of an Umpire’s Call, the Player Review shall be categorised as ‘Unchanged – \\\\nUmpire’s Call’. A Player Review categorised as ‘Unchanged – Umpire’s Call’ shall not count towards the \\\\ninnings limit set out in paragraph 3.6.1. \\\\n \\\\n89 \\\\n3.6.5 Where, following a request for a Player Review, the original on-field decision of Out is unchanged, but for a \\\\ndifferent mode of dismissal from the original on-field decision, then the Player Review shall still be \\\\ncategorised as ’Unsuccessful’. \\\\n3.6.6 Where, following a request for a Player Review, the original on-field decision of Not out is unchanged on \\\\naccount of the delivery being a No ball (for any reason), thereby not requiring any further evaluation, the \\\\nPlayer Review shall not be counted as ‘Unsuccessful’ and accordingly shall not count towards the innings \\\\nlimit set out in paragraph 3.6.1. \\\\n3.6.7 Where a Player Review and an Umpire Review are requested from the same delivery and the decision of \\\\nthe third umpire from the Umpire Review renders the Player Review unnecessary (see paragraphs 3.9.2 and \\\\n3.9.3), the Player Review request shall be disregarded and accordingly shall not count towards the innings \\\\nlimit set out in paragraph 3.6.1. \\\\n3.6.8 A Player Review categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ may be reinstated by the ICC Match Referee at his/her sole \\\\ndiscretion (if appropriate after consultation with the ICC Technical Official and/or the television broadcast \\\\ndirector) if the Player Review could not properly be concluded due to a failure of the technology. Any such \\\\ndecision shall be final and shall be taken as soon as possible, being communicated to both teams once all \\\\nthe relevant facts have been ascertained by the ICC Match Referee. A Player Review categorised as \\\\n‘Unsuccessful’ shall not be reinstated if, despite any technical failures, the correct decision could still have \\\\nbeen made using the other available technology. Similarly, a Player Review categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ \\\\nshall not be reinstated where the technology worked as intended, but the evidence gleaned from its use was \\\\ninconclusive. \\\\n3.6.9 The third umpire shall be responsible for counting the number Player Reviews categorised as ‘Unsuccessful’ \\\\nand shall advise the on-field umpires once either team has exhausted their allowance for the innings. \\\\n3.6.10 The scoreboard shall display, for the innings in progress, the number of Player Reviews remaining available \\\\nto each team. \\\\nCategory of Player Review Outcome of Player Review  Consequence of Player Review \\\\nSuccessful (paragraph 3.6.2) On-field decision reversed  Does not count towards innings \\\\nlimit set out in paragraph 3.6.1 \\\\nUnsuccessful (paragraphs 3.6.3 \\\\nand 3.6.5) \\\\nOn-field decision unchanged Counts towards innings limit set \\\\nout in paragraph 3.6.1 \\\\nUnchanged – Umpire’s Call \\\\n(paragraph 3.6.4) \\\\nOn-field decision unchanged Does not count towards innings \\\\nlimit set out in paragraph 3.6.1 \\\\nNo ball – no evaluation required \\\\n(paragraph 3.6.6) \\\\nOn-field decision unchanged Does not count towards innings \\\\nlimit set out in paragraph 3.6.1 \\\\nFailure of technology (paragraph \\\\n3.6.8) \\\\nOn-field decision unchanged Does not count towards innings \\\\nlimit set out in paragraph 3.6.1 \\\\n \\\\n3.7 Dead ball \\\\n3.7.1 If following a Player Review request, an original decision of Out is changed to Not out, then the ball is still \\\\ndeemed to have become dead when the original decision was made (as per clause 20.1.1.3). The batting \\\\nside, while benefiting from the reversal of the dismissal, shall not benefit from any runs that may \\\\nsubsequently have accrued from the delivery had the on-field umpire originally made a Not out decision, \\\\nother than any No ball penalty that could arise under paragraph 3.3.5 above. \\\\n3.7.2 If an original decision of Not out is changed to Out, the ball shall retrospectively be deemed to have become \\\\ndead from the moment of the dismissal event. All subsequent events, including any runs scored, shall be \\\\nignored. \\\\n \\\\n90 \\\\n3.8 Use of technology \\\\n3.8.1 The following technology may be used by the third umpire during a Player Review: \\\\n3.8.1.1 Replays, at any speed, from any available broadcast camera \\\\n3.8.1.2 Sound from the stump microphones with the replays at normal speed and slow motion \\\\n3.8.1.3 Approved ball-tracking technology:  \\\\n• HawkEye (HawkEye Innovations), or; \\\\n• VirtualEye (ARL) \\\\n3.8.1.4 Approved sound-based edge detection technology: \\\\n• Real-Time Snickometer (BBG Sports), or; \\\\n• UltraEdge (HawkEye Innovations) \\\\n3.8.1.5 Approved heat-based edge detection technology: \\\\n• Hot Spot cameras (BBG Sports) \\\\n3.8.1.6 LED Wickets (using the lights to indicate if the wicket is broken, as set out in paragraph 4.2): \\\\n• Zing Bails and Stumps \\\\n3.8.2 In addition, other forms of technology may be used subject to the ICC being satisfied that the required \\\\nstandards of accuracy and time efficiency can be met. \\\\n3.8.3 Where practical usage or further testing indicates that any of the above forms of technology cannot reliably \\\\nprovide accurate and timely information, then it may be removed prior to or during a match. The final \\\\ndecision regarding the technology to be used in a given match shall be taken by the ICC Match Referee in \\\\nconsultation with the ICC Technical Official, ICC management and the competing teams’ governing bodies. \\\\n3.9 Combining Umpire Review with Player Review \\\\n3.9.1 If an Umpire Review (under paragraph 2) and a request for a Player Review (under paragraph 3) are made \\\\nfollowing the same delivery but relating to separate modes of dismissal, the following process shall apply. \\\\n3.9.2 The Umpire Review shall be carried out prior to the Player Review if all of the following conditions apply: \\\\n3.9.2.1 The Player Review has been requested by the fielding side \\\\n3.9.2.2 The Umpire Review and the Player Review both relate to the dismissal of the same batter \\\\n3.9.2.3 If the batter is out, the number of runs scored from the delivery would be the same for both modes \\\\nof dismissal \\\\n3.9.2.4 If the batter is out, the batter on strike for the next delivery would be the same for both modes of \\\\ndismissal. \\\\n3.9.3 If the Umpire Review leads the third umpire to make a decision of Out, then this shall be displayed in the \\\\nusual manner and the Player Review shall not be undertaken. If the Umpire Review results in a Not out \\\\ndecision, then the third umpire shall make no public decision but shall proceed to address the request for a \\\\nPlayer Review. \\\\n3.9.4 For illustration, following an LBW appeal which is given Not out by the bowler’s end umpire, the striker sets \\\\noff for a run, is sent back and there is an appeal for his run out. The players request that the LBW decision is \\\\nreviewed and the umpires request that the run out be reviewed. The four criteria above are satisfied, so the \\\\nrun out referral is determined first. Should the appeal for run out be Out, then there is no requirement for the \\\\nLBW review to take place. \\\\n \\\\n91 \\\\n3.9.5 In all other circumstances, the incidents shall be addressed in chronological order. If the conclusion from the \\\\nfirst incident is that a batter is dismissed, then the ball would be deemed to have become dead at that point, \\\\nrendering investigation of the second incident unnecessary. \\\\n4 Interpretation of Playing Conditions \\\\n4.1 When using a replay to determine the moment at which the wicket has been put down (as per clause 29.1), \\\\nthe third umpire shall deem this to be the first frame in which one of the bails is shown (or can be deduced) \\\\nto have lost all contact with the top of the stumps and subsequent frames show the bail permanently \\\\nremoved from the top of the stumps. \\\\n4.2 Where LED Wickets are used (as provided for in paragraph 3.8.1.6) the moment at which the wicket has \\\\nbeen put down (as per clause 29.1) shall be deemed to be the first frame in which the LED lights are \\\\nilluminated and subsequent frames show the bail permanently removed from the top of the stumps. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n92 \\\\nAppendix E  \\\\n \\\\nCalculations  \\\\nTable 1: Calculation sheet for use when a delay or interruptions occur in the First Innings   \\\\nTime  \\\\nNet playing time available at start of the match   420 minutes (A)  \\\\nTime innings in progress      ___________ (B)  \\\\nPlaying time lost       ___________ (C)  \\\\nExtra time available      ___________ (D)  \\\\nTime made up from reduced interval    ___________ (E)  \\\\nEffective playing time lost [C – (D + E)]    ___________ (F)  \\\\nRemaining playing time available (A -

Other than where expressly stated in this Appendix (or by necessary implication), all relevant Playing \\\\nConditions for the match shall apply to the Super Over. \\\\n1. A Super Over involves each team facing an over of six balls (unless ended earlier as provided for in paragraph \\\\n2), and the winner shall be the team scoring the greater number of runs, irrespective of the number of wickets \\\\nlost.  \\\\n \\\\n2. The loss of two wickets shall end the batting team’s one over innings. \\\\n \\\\n3. If the Super Over is a tie, subsequent Super Overs shall be played until a winner is determined. Other than in \\\\nexceptional circumstances (as set out in paragraph 25 below), an unlimited number of Super Overs may be \\\\nplayed where necessary to determine a result. \\\\n \\\\n4. Subject to weather conditions, the Super Over shall take place on the scheduled day of the match at a time to \\\\nbe determined by the ICC Match Referee. In normal circumstances it shall commence 5 minutes after the \\\\nconclusion of the match. \\\\n \\\\n5. The Super Over shall be played until completion, but if there are any delays or interruptions during the Super \\\\nOver, extra time (taken from the start of the first Super Over) is allocated to complete the Super Over or any \\\\nsubsequent Super Overs. The amount of extra time allocated to the Super Over is the greater of; \\\\na) the gap between the time at which the match ended and the time the original match would have been \\\\nscheduled to finish had the entire extra time provision been utilized, or \\\\nb) 20 minutes. \\\\n \\\\n6. Should play be delayed prior to or during the Super Over(s) once the playing time lost exceeds the extra time \\\\nallocated, the Super Over(s) shall be abandoned (see paragraph 24 below). \\\\n \\\\n7. The Super Over shall take place on the pitch allocated for the match, unless otherwise determined by the \\\\numpires in consultation with the Ground Authority and the ICC Match Referee. \\\\n \\\\n8. Only nominated players in the match (including Concussion Replacements) may participate in the Super Over.  \\\\n \\\\n9. Any penalty time being served in the match shall be carried forward to the Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n10. The umpires shall stand at the same end at which they finished the match. \\\\n \\\\n11. The team batting second in the match shall bat first in the Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n12. Each Team shall be allowed one unsuccessful player review per innings per Super Over. This entitlement \\\\nshall apply irrespective of the number of unsuccessful Player Review requests made during the match itself.  \\\\n \\\\n13. The captain of the fielding team (or his nominee) shall select the ball with which the fielding team shall bowl \\\\nits over in the Super Over from the box of spare balls provided by the umpires (which shall include the balls \\\\nused in the match, but no new ball s).  The team fielding second may then choose to use the same ball as \\\\n \\\\n96 \\\\nchosen by the team bowling first or choose another ball from the same box. If the ball needs to be changed, \\\\nthe relevant Playing Conditions as they apply in the match shall also apply in the Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n14. The fielding side shall choose the end from which it is to bowl its one over. \\\\n \\\\n15. The Super Over shall be played with the same fielding restrictions as would be applicable for the last over in \\\\nan uninterrupted match. \\\\n \\\\n16. The interval between the two overs in the Super Over shall be 5 minutes. \\\\n \\\\nTIED SUPER OVER – REPEATING THE SUPER OVER \\\\n \\\\n17. If the Super Over is tied, then subsequent Super Overs shall be played until there is a winner (subject to \\\\nparagraph 25). \\\\n \\\\n18. In normal circumstances any subsequent Super Over shall start 5 minutes after the previous Super Over ends. \\\\n \\\\n19. The team batting second in the previous Super Over shall bat first in the subsequent Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n20. The balls selected for use by each team in the previous Super Over shall be used again by the same team in \\\\nany subsequent Super Over(s). \\\\n \\\\n21. The fielding side shall bowl its over in a subsequent Super Over from the opposite end from which it bowled \\\\nin the previous Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n22. Any batter dismissed in any previous Super Over shall be ineligible to bat in any subsequent Super Over.For \\\\nthe avoidance of doubt, Retiring Out is a dismissal for these purposes. \\\\n \\\\n23. Any bowler who bowled in the previous Super Over shall be ineligible to bowl in the subsequent Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n24. In all other ways the procedure for a subsequent Super Over shall be the same as for the initial Super Over. \\\\n \\\\nSUPER OVER UNABLE TO BE COMPLETED \\\\n25. Where the Super Over or subsequent Super Overs are abandoned for any reason prior to completion then \\\\nthe match shall be declared a tie and points allocated as in Clause 16.11.1. \\\\n \\\\n26. In circumstances where there are unavoidable time constraints (for example, a requirement to switch off \\\\nfloodlights at a certain time) which do not allow the completion of multiple Super Overs, the ICC Match Referee \\\\nmay limit the number of possible Super O vers and shall advise both captains accordingly prior to the start of \\\\nthe first Super Over. \\\\n \\\\nEXAMPLES - EXTRA TIME AVAILABLE FOR THE SUPER OVER \\\\nExample 1: The match is scheduled to finish at 10.20pm, with 60 minutes of extra time available to be used. The \\\\nscheduled cut-off time if all the available extra time is used would be 11.20pm. The match runs over time and finishes \\\\nin a tie at 10.35pm. The Super Over is scheduled to start 5 minutes later at 10.40pm. The extra time available to \\\\ncomplete the Super Over would be 45 minutes (as per paragraph 5(a) above). \\\\n• The Super Over starts on time but is interrupted at 10.50pm for 10 minutes (leaving 35 minutes of extra time still \\\\navailable). \\\\n• Play resumes at 11.00pm with a tied Super Over occurring. \\\\n• The second super over is being played but is interrupted at 11.15pm. \\\\n \\\\n97 \\\\n• Play does not resume within 35 minutes (being the amount of extra time still available), therefore the Super Over \\\\nprocedure is abandoned, and the match is a tie. \\\\nExample 2: The same match is scheduled to finish at 10.20pm, but with 30 minutes of extra time available to be used. \\\\nThe scheduled cut -off time if all the available extra time is used would be 10.50pm. The match runs over time and \\\\nfinishes in a tie at 10.35pm. The Super Over is scheduled to start 5 minutes later at 10.40pm. The extra time available \\\\nto complete the Super Over would be 20 minutes (as per paragraph 5(b) above). \\\\n \\\\nAppendix H \\\\nOn Field Injury Assessments and Treatment \\\\nThe umpires will allow an initial 4 minutes for medical staff to treat the injured player. Umpires may inform the medical \\\\nteam when there is 90 seconds remaining, after which, the player should be removed from the field of play if further \\\\nassessment/treatment is required. The on-field umpires will consider each incident when applying the 4-minute \\\\nguideline and be guided by the appointed Match Day Doctor or his/her nominated replacement. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n98 \\\\n \\\\nAppendix I \\\\nApplication of the Reserve Day for the Semi-Finals and the Final  \\\\nIf play is interrupted on the scheduled day, the umpires shall use the available extra time and, if necessary, reduce \\\\nthe number of overs to try to achieve a result on that day.  \\\\nIn making their decisions in relation to ground, weather and light, the umpires shall aim to maximise play on the \\\\nscheduled day of the match in order to achieve a result on that day, as if there was no Reserve Day available.  \\\\nEach team must have had the opportunity to bat for a minimum of twenty five (25) overs for a result to be achieved. If \\\\nplay has not resumed by the cut-off time required to allow the minimum number of overs to be bowled to achieve a \\\\nresult on the scheduled day, play shall be abandoned for the day and the Reserve Day shall be used to either \\\\ncomplete or replay the match.  \\\\nIf the Reserve Day is used to continue an incomplete match the Reserve Day shall be used. \\\\nThe hours of play on the Reserve Day shall be as follows: \\\\nSemi-final 1 shall start at 12h00. \\\\nSemi-Final 2 shall start at 14h00. \\\\nThe Final shall start at 14h00. \\\\nOn the Reserve Day, play shall recommence under the same assumption that the last ball was bowled on the \\\\nscheduled day.  \\\\nThe match starts when the coin toss takes place and teams are exchanged. If the toss occurs on the scheduled day \\\\nand there is no play thereafter, the result of the toss and the named teams shall be carried through to the Reserve \\\\nDay.  \\\\nThe treatment of the pitch on the Reserve Day by the Ground Authority shall be as follows: \\\\n• Covering and removal of covers – as for the scheduled day of the match under clause 10 of the Playing \\\\nConditions; and \\\\n• Mowing and rolling – as for Day 2 of a Test Match, under clause 9 of the ICC Test Match Playing Conditions.  \\\\nExample 1: Match starts at 50 overs per side and there is an interruption at 19 overs. Overs are reduced to \\\\n46 overs per side and play is about to resume. Before another ball is bowled it rains and play is abandoned \\\\nfor the day. As the match did not resume under the revised overs, the match should continue on the \\\\nReserve Day at the original 50 overs per side with the overs reduced if necessary during the Reserve Day.  \\\\n \\\\nExample 2: The same start as in example 1 i.e. match starts at 50 overs per side and there is an interruption \\\\nat 19 overs. Overs are reduced to 46 overs per side and play is about to resume. This time, play starts and \\\\nafter an over has been bowled it rains and play is abandoned for the day. As the match has resumed, it is \\\\ncontinued on the Reserve Day at 46 overs per side with the overs further reduced if necessary during the \\\\nReserve Day. \\\\n \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\n99 \\\\n \\\\nAppendix J \\\\nSummary of changes to Playing Conditions for warm up matches \\\\nNOTE: \\\\nThe ICC Champions Trophy 2025 warm-up matches will not be official One Day Internationals. \\\\nICC Match Referees will not be on duty for warm-up matches. The Code of Conduct will apply and any \\\\nbreaches will be reported to and dealt with by the Event Technical Committee. \\\\n \\\\nExcept as varied hereunder the ICC Men’s Twenty20 World Cup 20224 Playing Conditions shall apply. \\\\n1.1 Number of Players \\\\nEach side shall consist of a maximum 15 players. \\\\n1.2 Nomination and replacement of Players \\\\nEach team may nominate no more than 15 players. \\\\nNo more than 11 may bat in one innings. \\\\nThe players to bat may be determined as the match progresses and need not be nominated in \\\\nadvance. No more than 11 of the 15 players may field at any one time, with teams free to change \\\\ntheir fielders subject to the umpires being informed and play not being delayed. \\\\n \\\\nA player who has not been nominated amongst the 15 may field but will be subject to the usual \\\\nprovisions relating to substitutes. \\\\n \\\\nAny of the nominated players may bowl or keep wicket. However for a bowler to bowl consecutive \\\\novers from one end, he must remain on the field throughout the intervening over bowled from the \\\\nother end. \\\\n \\\\nRegulations regarding \\'penalty time\\' to be served by Batters or bowlers before they are allowed to \\\\nbat or bowl shall not apply. \\\\n \\\\n6.3.2 Selection and preparation \\\\nReplace third umpire or fourth umpire with on-field umpires or third umpire. \\\\n6.4 Changing the pitch \\\\nRemove reference to Match Referee \\\\n11.4 Changing agreed time for intervals \\\\nReplace Match Referee with umpires \\\\n13.1.1 Number of innings \\\\nThere are no reserve days for the warm up matches. \\\\n16.2 ICC Match Referee Awarding a Match \\\\nReplace Match Referee with umpires \\\\n16.10 Competition Format \\\\nShall not apply \\\\n24.2 Fielder absent or leaving the field \\\\n \\\\n100 \\\\nShall not apply. \\\\n41.9.4 – the provisions for the stop clock shall apply to all warm-up matches. \\\\n42 Players’ Conduct \\\\nRemove reference to Match Referee. \\\\nAppendix D – shall not apply. \\\\nAppendix F – shall not apply. \\\\nAppendix G shall not apply. \\\\nAppendix I shall not apply. \\\\n

according to the Laws  \\\\n(which are incorporated within these Playing Conditions), but also within the Spirit of Cricket.  \\\\nThe major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains, but extends to all play ers, match officials and, \\\\nespecially in junior cricket, teachers, coaches and parents. \\\\nRespect is central to the Spirit of Cricket. \\\\nRespect your captain, team-mates, opponents and the authority of the umpires. \\\\nPlay hard and play fair. \\\\nAccept the umpire’s decision. \\\\nCreate a positive atmosphere by your own conduct, and encourage others to do likewise. \\\\nShow self-discipline, even when things go against you. \\\\nCongratulate the opposition on their successes, and enjoy those of your own team. \\\\nThank the officials and your opposition at the end of the match, whatever the result. \\\\nCricket is an exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship and teamwork, which brings together peopl e from \\\\ndifferent nationalities, cultures and religions, especially when played within the Spirit of Cricket. \\\\n1 THE PLAYERS \\\\n1.1 Number of players \\\\nA match is played between two sides, each of eleven players, one of whom shall be captain. \\\\n1.2 Nomination and replacement of players \\\\n1.2.1 Each captain shall nominate 11 players plus a maximum of 4 substitute fielders in writing to the ICC \\\\nTournament Referee before the toss.  Other than set out in clause 1.2.7, no player (member of the playing \\\\neleven) may be changed after the nomination and prior to the start of play without the consent of the \\\\nopposing captain. \\\\n1.2.2 Only those nominated as substitute fielders shall be entitled to act as substitute fielders during the match, \\\\nunless the ICC Tournament Referee, in exceptional circumstances, allows subsequent additions. \\\\n1.2.3 All those nominated including those nominated as substitute fielders, as well as any Concussion \\\\nReplacements, must be eligible to play for that particular team and by such nomination the nominees shall \\\\nwarrant that they are so eligible. \\\\n1.2.4 In addition, by their nomination, the nominees shall be deemed to have agreed to abide by all the applicable \\\\nICC Regulations pertaining to international cricket and in particular, the Clothing and Equipment \\\\nRegulations, the Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel (hereafter referred to as the \\\\nICC Code of Conduct), the Anti- Discrimination Code for Players and Player Support Personnel, the Anti-\\\\nDoping Code and the Anti-Corruption Code. \\\\n1.2.5 A player or player support personnel who has been suspended from participating in a match shall not, from \\\\nthe toss of the coin and for the remainder of the match thereafter: \\\\n1.2.5.1 Be nominated as, or carry out any of the duties or responsibilities of a substitute fielder, or \\\\n1.2.5.2 Enter any part of the playing area (which shall include the field of play and the area between the \\\\nboundary and the perimeter boards) at any time, including any scheduled or unscheduled breaks in \\\\nplay. \\\\n2 \\\\n1.2.6 A player who has been suspended from participating in a match shall be permitted from the toss of the coin \\\\nand for the remainder of the match thereafter be permitted to enter the players’ dressing room provided that \\\\nthe players’ dressing room (or any part thereof) for the match is not within the playing area described in \\\\nclause 1.2.5.2 above (for example, the player is not permitted to enter the on-field ‘dug-out’). \\\\n1.2.7 Concussion Replacement \\\\n1.2.7.1 If a player sustains a concussion or suspected concussion as a result of a head or neck injury during the \\\\ncourse of the relevant match, a Concussion Replacement may be permitted in the following circumstances: \\\\n1.2.7.1.1 the head or neck injury must have been sustained during play and within the playing area \\\\ndescribed in clause 1.2.5.2 above; \\\\n1.2.7.1.2 a concussion or suspected concussion must have been formally diagnosed by the Team Medical \\\\nRepresentative; \\\\n1.2.7.1.3 the Team Medical Representative or Team Manager shall submit a Concussion Replacement \\\\nRequest to the ICC Tournament Referee on a standard form, which shall: \\\\n1.2.7.1.3.1 identify the player who has sustained the concussion or suspected concussion;  \\\\n1.2.7.1.3.2 specify the incident in which the concussion or suspected concussion was \\\\nsustained, including the time at which it occurred; \\\\n1.2.7.1.3.3 confirm that, following an examination, the Team Medical Representative believes \\\\nor suspects that the player has sustained a concussion as a result of the incident \\\\nspecified in clause 1.2.7.1.3.2 above; and  \\\\n1.2.7.1.3.4 identify the requested Concussion Replacement, who shall be a like-for-like \\\\nreplacement for the player who has sustained the concussion or suspected \\\\nconcussion. If a like-for-like replacement is not available, the nearest like-for-like \\\\nreplacement from the official squad of the participating team may be submitted as \\\\nthe Concussion Replacement. \\\\nIn circumstances where a team is unable to provide a Concussion Replacement, a male member \\\\nof the relevant team’s management will be permitted to act as a substitute \\\\n1.2.7.2 The Concussion Replacement Request must be submitted as soon as possible after the incident specified in \\\\nclause 1.2.7.1.3.2 if a Concussion Replacement is to be permitted. \\\\n1.2.7.3 The ICC Tournament Referee should ordinarily approve a Concussion Replacement Request if the \\\\nreplacement is a like-for-like player whose inclusion will not excessively advantage his team for the \\\\nremainder of the match. \\\\n1.2.7.4 In assessing whether the nominated Concussion Replacement should be considered a like-for-like player, \\\\nthe ICC Tournament Referee should consider the likely role the concussed player would have played during \\\\nthe remainder of the match, and the normal role that would be performed by the nominated Concussion \\\\nReplacement. \\\\n1.2.7.5 If the ICC Tournament Referee believes that the inclusion of the nominated Concussion Replacement, when \\\\nperforming their normal role, would excessively advantage their team, the ICC Tournament Referee may \\\\nimpose such conditions upon the identity and involvement of the Concussion Replacement as he/she sees \\\\nfit, in line with the overriding objective of facilitating a like-for-like replacement for the concussed player. \\\\nFor clarity, a concussion replacement will not be permitted to bowl during the innings and/or for the \\\\nremainder of the match if the replaced player was suspended from bowling for any reason at the time they \\\\nwere replaced. \\\\n1.2.7.6 The ICC Tournament Referee may, in reviewing a Concussion Replacement Request made in accordance \\\\nwith clause 1.2.7.1.3, request any such further information as may be required in order to make the \\\\ndetermination required under clauses 1.2.7.4 and 1.2.7.5. \\\\n3 \\\\n1.2.7.7 The decision of the ICC Tournament Referee in relation to any Concussion Replacement Request shall be \\\\nfinal and neither team shall have any right of appeal. \\\\n1.2.7.8 Once the Concussion Replacement has been approved by the ICC Tournament Referee, the replaced \\\\nplayer shall play no further part in the match. \\\\n1.2.7.9 Both the Concussion Replacement and the replaced player shall be considered to have played in the match \\\\nfor records and statistical purposes. \\\\n \\\\n1.3 Captain \\\\n1.3.1 If at any time the captain is not available, a deputy shall act for him. \\\\n1.3.2 If a captain is not available to nominate the players, then any person associated with that team may act as \\\\nhis deputy to do so. See clause1.2. \\\\n1.3.3 At any time after the nomination of the players, only a nominated player can act as deputy in discharging the \\\\nduties and responsibilities of the captain as stated in these Playing Conditions, including at the toss. See \\\\nclause 13.4 (The toss). \\\\n1.4 Responsibility of captains \\\\nThe captains are responsible at all times for ensuring that play is conducted within The Spirit of Cricket as well as \\\\nwithin these Playing Conditions. \\\\n2 THE UMPIRES \\\\n2.1 Appointment and attendance \\\\nThe following rules for the selection and appointment of ODI umpires shall be followed as far as it is practicable to do \\\\nso: \\\\n2.1.1 The umpires shall control the game as required by these Playing Conditions, with absolute impartiality and \\\\nshall be present at the ground at least 1.5 hours before the scheduled start of play. \\\\n2.1.2 The following Match Officials are to be appointed for each ODI Match: \\\\n2.1.2.1 One (1) ICC Tournament Referee, appointed by the ICC from an ICC Panel of Match Referees. \\\\nThe ICC Tournament Referee shall not be from the same country as any of the participating \\\\nteams \\\\n2.1.2.2 Two (2) on-field umpires, appointed by the ICC from an ICC International Panel and Associate \\\\nPanel of umpires.  \\\\n2.1.2.3 One (1) third umpire, appointed by the ICC. The third umpire shall act as the emergency on-field \\\\numpire. In exceptional circumstances, the third umpire may be from the same country as one of \\\\nthe participating teams.  \\\\n2.1.3 The ICC shall advise the Host Board and participating members of the names of its appointees prior to the \\\\nstart of the tournament. \\\\n2.1.4 No team shall have a right of objection to the appointment of any umpire or match referee. \\\\n2.2 Change of umpire \\\\nAn umpire shall not be changed during the match, other than in exceptional circumstances, unless he/she is injured \\\\nor ill. \\\\n2.3 Consultation with Host Board \\\\nBefore the match the umpires shall consult with the Host Board to determine; \\\\n4 \\\\n2.3.1 the balls to be used during the match. See clause 4 (The ball). \\\\n2.3.2 the hours of play and the times and durations of any agreed intervals.  \\\\n2.3.3 which clock or watch and back-up time piece is to be used during the match. \\\\n2.3.4 the boundary of the field of play. See clause 19 (Boundaries). \\\\n2.3.5 the use of covers. See clause 10 (Covering the pitch). \\\\n2.3.6 any special conditions of play affecting the conduct of the match. \\\\ninform the scorers of agreements in 2.3.2, 2.3.3, 2.3.4 and 2.3.6. \\\\n2.4 The wickets, creases and boundaries \\\\nBefore the toss and during the match, the umpires shall satisfy themselves that \\\\n2.4.1 the creases are correctly marked. See clause 7 (The creases). \\\\n2.4.2 the wickets are properly pitched. See clause 8 (The wickets) \\\\n2.4.3 the boundary of the field of play complies with the requirements of clauses 19.1 (Determining the boundary \\\\nof the field of play), 19.2 (Identifying and marking the boundary) and 19.3 (Restoring the boundary). \\\\n2.5 Conduct of the match, implements and equipment \\\\nBefore the toss and during the match, the umpires shall satisfy themselves that \\\\n2.5.1 the conduct of the match is strictly in accordance with these Playing Conditions. \\\\n2.5.2 the implements used in the match conform to the following \\\\n2.5.2.1 clause 4 (The ball). \\\\n2.5.2.2 externally visible requirements of clause 5 (The bat) and paragraph 1 of Appendix B \\\\n2.5.2.3 either clauses 8.2 (Size of stumps) and 8.3 (The bails). \\\\n2.5.3 no player uses equipment other than that permitted. See paragraph 2 of Appendix A. Note particularly \\\\ntherein the interpretation of ‘protective helmet’. \\\\n2.5.4 the wicket-keeper’s gloves comply with the requirements of clause 27.2 (Gloves). \\\\n2.6 Fair and unfair play \\\\nThe umpires shall be the sole judges of fair and unfair play. \\\\n2.7 Fitness for play \\\\n2.7.1 It is solely for the umpires together to decide whether either conditions of ground, weather or light or \\\\nexceptional circumstances mean that it would be dangerous or unreasonable for play to take place. \\\\nConditions shall not be regarded as either dangerous or unreasonable merely because they are not ideal. \\\\nThe fact that the grass and the ball are wet does not warrant the ground conditions being regarded as \\\\nunreasonable or dangerous. \\\\n2.7.2 Conditions shall be regarded as dangerous if there is actual and foreseeable risk to the safety of any player \\\\nor umpire. \\\\n2.7.3 Conditions shall be regarded as unreasonable if, although posing no risk to safety, it would not be sensible \\\\nfor play to proceed. \\\\n2.7.4 If the umpires consider the ground is so wet or slippery as to deprive the bowler of a reasonable foothold, \\\\nthe fielders of the power of free movement, or the batters of the ability to play their strokes or to run between \\\\n5 \\\\nthe wickets, then these conditions shall be regarded as so bad that it would be dangerous and unreasonable \\\\nfor play to take place. \\\\n2.8 Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable \\\\ncircumstances \\\\n2.8.1 All references to ground include the pitch. See clause 6.1 (Area of pitch). \\\\n2.8.2 If at any time the umpires together agree that the conditions of ground, weather or light, or any other \\\\ncircumstances are dangerous or unreasonable, they shall immediately suspend play, or not allow play to \\\\nstart or to recommence. The decision as to whether conditions are so bad as to warrant such action is one \\\\nfor the umpires alone to make, following consultation with the ICC Tournament Referee. \\\\n2.8.3 If circumstances are warranted, the umpires shall stop play and instruct the Ground Authority to take \\\\nwhatever action they can and use whatever equipment is necessary to remove as much dew as possible \\\\nfrom the outfield when conditions become unreasonable or dangerous. The umpires may also instruct the \\\\nground staff to take such action during scheduled and unscheduled breaks in play. \\\\n2.8.4 The umpires shall disregard any shadow on the pitch from the stadium or from any permanent object on the \\\\nground. \\\\n2.8.5 Light Meters \\\\nLight meter will not be used. \\\\n2.8.6 Use of artificial lights \\\\nIf in the opinion of the umpires, natural light is deteriorating to an unfit level, they shall authorize the Ground \\\\nAuthority to use the available artificial lighting so that the match can commence or continue in acceptable \\\\nconditions. \\\\nIn the event of power failure or lights malfunction, the provisions relating to the delay or interruption of play \\\\ndue to bad weather or light shall apply. \\\\n2.8.7 When there is a suspension of play it is the responsibility of the umpires to monitor conditions. They shall \\\\nmake inspections as often as appropriate, unaccompanied by any players or officials. Immediately the \\\\numpires together agree that the conditions are no longer dangerous or unreasonable they shall call upon the \\\\nplayers to resume play. \\\\n2.8.8 The safety of all persons within the ground is of paramount importance to the ICC. In the event that of any \\\\nthreatening circumstance, whether actual or perceived (including for example weather, pitch invasions, act \\\\nof God, etc.), then the umpires, on the advice of the ICC Tournament Referee, should suspend play and all \\\\nplayers and officials should immediately be asked to leave the field of play in a safe and orderly manner and \\\\nto relocate to a secure and safe area (depending on each particular threat) pending the satisfactory passing \\\\nor resolution of such threat or risk to the reasonable satisfaction of the umpires, the ICC Tournament \\\\nReferee, the head of the relevant Ground Authority, the head of ground security and/or the police as the \\\\ncircumstances may require. \\\\n2.8.9 Where play is suspended under clause 2.8.8 above the decision to abandon or resume play shall be the \\\\nresponsibility of the ICC Tournament Referee who shall act only after consultation with the head of ground \\\\nsecurity and the police. \\\\n2.9 Position of umpires \\\\nThe umpires shall stand where they can best see any act upon which their decision may be required. \\\\nSubject to this over-riding consideration, the bowler’s end umpire shall stand in a position so as not to interfere with \\\\neither the bowler’s run-up or the striker’s view. \\\\nThe striker’s end umpire may elect to stand on the off side instead of the on side of the pitch, provided he/she informs \\\\nthe captain of the fielding side, the striker and the other umpire. \\\\n6 \\\\n2.10 Umpires changing ends \\\\nShall not apply. \\\\n2.11 Disagreement and dispute \\\\nWhere there is disagreement or dispute about any matter, the umpires together shall make the final decision. See \\\\nalso clause 31.6 (Consultation by umpires). \\\\n2.12 Umpire’s decision \\\\nAn umpire may alter any decision provided that such alteration is made promptly and does not contradict clause 20.6 \\\\n(Dead ball not to be revoked). This apart, an umpire’s decision, once made, is final. \\\\n2.13 Signals \\\\n2.13.1 The following code of signals shall be used by umpires. \\\\n2.13.1.1 Signals made while the ball is in play \\\\nNo ball - by extending one arm horizontally. \\\\nOut - by raising an index finger above the head. (If not out, the umpire shall call Not out.) \\\\nWide - by extending both arms horizontally. \\\\nDead ball - by crossing and re-crossing the wrists below the waist. \\\\n2.13.1.2 When the ball is dead, the bowler’s end umpire shall repeat the signals in clause 2.13.1.1, with the \\\\nexception of the signal for Out, to the scorers. \\\\n2.13.1.3 The signals listed below shall be made to the scorers only when the ball is dead. \\\\nBoundary 4 - by waving an arm from side to side finishing with the arm across the chest \\\\nBoundary 6 - by raising both arms above the head. \\\\nBye - by raising an open hand above the head. \\\\nFive Penalty runs awarded to the batting side - by repeated tapping of one shoulder with the \\\\nopposite hand. \\\\nFive Penalty runs awarded to the fielding side - by placing one hand on the opposite shoulder. \\\\nLeg bye - by touching a raised knee with the hand. \\\\nRevoke last signal - by touching both shoulders, each with the opposite hand. \\\\nShort run - by bending one arm upwards and touching the nearer shoulder with the tips of the \\\\nfingers. \\\\nFree Hit – after signaling the No ball, the bowler’s end umpire extends one arm straight upwards \\\\nand moves it in a circular motion. \\\\nPowerplay Over – by rotating his arm in a large circle. \\\\nThe following signal is for Level 4 player conduct offences. The signal has two parts, both of which should be \\\\nacknowledged separately by the scorers. \\\\nLevel 4 conduct Part 1 - by putting one arm out to the side of the body and repeatedly raising it and \\\\nlowering it. \\\\nPart 2 - by raising an index finger, held at shoulder height, to the side of the body. \\\\n2.13.1.4 All the signals in clause 2.13.1.3 are to be made by the bowler’s end umpire except that for Short \\\\nrun, which is to be signaled by the umpire at the end where short running occurs. However, the \\\\nbowler’s end umpire shall be responsible both for the final signal of Short run to the scorers and, if \\\\nmore than one run is short, for informing them as to the number of runs to be recorded. \\\\n7 \\\\n2.13.2 The umpire shall wait until each signal to the scorers has been separately acknowledged by a scorer before \\\\nallowing play to proceed. \\\\nIf several signals are to be used, they should be given in the order that the events occurred. \\\\n2.14 Informing the umpires \\\\nWherever the umpires are to receive information from captains or other players under these Playing Conditions, it will \\\\nbe sufficient for one umpire to be so informed and for him/her to inform the other umpire. \\\\n2.15 Correctness of scores \\\\nConsultation between umpires and scorers on doubtful points is essential. The umpires shall, throughout the match, \\\\nsatisfy themselves as to the correctness of the number of runs scored, the wickets that have fallen and, where \\\\nappropriate, the number of overs bowled. \\\\nThe umpires shall ensure that they are able to contact the scorers at any time during the match and at its conclusion \\\\nto address any issues relating to the correctness of scores. \\\\n3 THE SCORERS \\\\n3.1 Appointment of scorers \\\\nTwo scorers shall be appointed to record all runs scored, all wickets taken and, where appropriate, number of overs \\\\nbowled. \\\\n3.2 Correctness of scores \\\\nThe scorers shall frequently check to ensure that their records agree and consult with the umpires if necessary. See \\\\nclause 2.15 (Correctness of scores). \\\\n3.3 Acknowledging signals \\\\nThe scorers shall accept all instructions and signals given to them by the umpires and shall immediately acknowledge \\\\neach separate signal. \\\\n4 THE BALL \\\\n4.1 Weight and size \\\\nThe ball, when new, shall weigh not less than 5.5 ounces/155.9 g, nor more than 5.75 ounces/163 g, and shall \\\\nmeasure not less than 8.81 in/22.4 cm, nor more than 9 in/22.9 cm in circumference. \\\\n4.2 Approval and control of balls \\\\n4.2.1 The Host Board shall provide white Kookaburra Turf cricket balls and spare used balls for changing during a \\\\nmatch, which shall also be of the same brand.  \\\\n4.2.2 The fielding captain or his nominee may select the ball with which he wishes to bowl from the supply \\\\nprovided by the Host Board. The fourth umpire shall take a box containing at least  6 new balls to the \\\\ndressing room and supervise the selection of the ball. \\\\n4.2.3 The umpires shall retain possession of the match ball(s) throughout the duration of the match when play is \\\\nnot actually taking place. \\\\n4.2.4 During play umpires shall periodically and irregularly inspect the condition of the ball and shall retain \\\\npossession of it at the fall of a wicket, a drinks interval, or any other disruption in play. \\\\n4.3 New ball \\\\n4.3.1 Each fielding team shall have two new balls for its innings to be used in alternate overs i.e. one from each \\\\nend. \\\\n8 \\\\n4.3.2 In a match reduced to 25 overs or less per side before the first innings commences, each team shall have \\\\nonly one new ball for its Innings. \\\\n4.4 Ball lost or becoming unfit for play \\\\nIf, during play, the ball cannot be found or recovered or the umpires agree that it has become unfit for play through \\\\nnormal use, the umpires shall replace it with a ball which has had wear comparable with that which the previous ball \\\\nhad received before the need for its replacement. When the ball is replaced, the umpire shall inform the batters and \\\\nthe fielding captain. \\\\n5 THE BAT \\\\n5.1 The bat \\\\n5.1.1 The bat consists of two parts, a handle and a blade. \\\\n5.1.2 The basic requirements and measurements of the bat are set out in this clause with detailed specifications in \\\\nparagraph 1 of Appendix B. \\\\n5.2 The handle \\\\n5.2.1 The handle is to be made principally of cane and/or wood. \\\\n5.2.2 The part of the handle that is wholly outside the blade is defined to be the upper portion of the handle. It is a \\\\nstraight shaft for holding the bat. \\\\n5.2.3 The upper portion of the handle may be covered with a grip as defined in paragraph 1.2.2 of Appendix B. \\\\n5.3 The blade \\\\n5.3.1 The blade comprises the whole of the bat apart from the handle as defined in clause 5.2 and in paragraph \\\\n1.3 of Appendix B. \\\\n5.3.2 The blade shall consist solely of wood. \\\\n5.4 Protection and repair \\\\nSubject to the specifications in paragraph 1.4 of Appendix B. and providing clause 5.5 is not contravened, \\\\n5.4.1 solely for the purposes of \\\\neither protection from surface damage to the face, sides and shoulders of the blade \\\\nor repair to the blade after surface damage, \\\\nmaterial that is not rigid, either at the time of its application to the blade or subsequently, may be placed on \\\\nthese surfaces. \\\\n5.4.2 for repair of the blade after damage other than surface damage \\\\n5.4.2.1 solid material may be inserted into the blade. \\\\n5.4.2.2 The only material permitted for any insertion is wood with minimal essential adhesives. \\\\n5.4.3 to prevent damage to the toe, material may be placed on that part of the blade but shall not extend over any \\\\npart of the face, back or sides of the blade. \\\\n5.5 Damage to the ball \\\\n5.5.1 For any part of the bat, covered or uncovered, the hardness of the constituent materials and the surface \\\\ntexture thereof shall not be such that either or both could cause unacceptable damage to the ball. \\\\n5.5.2 Any material placed on any part of the bat, for whatever purpose, shall similarly not be such that it could \\\\ncause unacceptable damage to the ball. \\\\n9 \\\\n5.5.3 For the purpose of this clause, unacceptable damage is any change that is greater than normal wear and \\\\ntear caused by the ball striking the uncovered wooden surface of the blade. \\\\n5.6 Contact with the ball \\\\nIn these clauses, \\\\n5.6.1 reference to the bat shall imply that the bat is held in the batter’s hand or a glove worn on his hand, unless \\\\nstated otherwise. \\\\n5.6.2 contact between the ball and any of 5.6.2.1 to 5.6.2.4 \\\\n5.6.2.1 the bat itself \\\\n5.6.2.2 the batter’s hand holding the bat \\\\n5.6.2.3 any part of a glove worn on the batter’s hand holding the bat \\\\n5.6.2.4 any additional materials permitted under 5.4 \\\\nshall be regarded as the ball striking or touching the bat or being struck by the bat. \\\\n5.7 Bat size limits \\\\n5.7.1 The overall length of the bat, when the lower portion of the handle is inserted, shall not be more than 38 \\\\nin/96.52 cm. \\\\n5.7.2 The blade of the bat shall not exceed the following dimensions: \\\\nWidth: 4.25in / 10.8 cm \\\\nDepth: 2.64in / 6.7 cm \\\\nEdges: 1.56in / 4.0cm. \\\\nFurthermore, it should also be able to pass through a bat gauge as described in paragraph 1.6 of Appendix \\\\nB. \\\\n5.7.3 The handle shall not exceed 52% of the overall length of the bat. \\\\n5.7.4 The material permitted for covering the blade in clause 5.4.1 shall not exceed 0.04 in/0.1 cm in thickness. \\\\n5.7.5 The maximum permitted thickness of protective material placed on the toe of the blade is 0.12 in/0.3 cm. \\\\n5.8 Categories of bat \\\\n5.8.1 Type A bats conform to clauses 5.1 to 5.7 inclusive. \\\\n5.8.2 Only Type A bats may be used in ODI matches. \\\\n \\\\n6 THE PITCH \\\\n6.1 Area of pitch \\\\nThe pitch is a rectangular area of the ground 22 yards/20.12 m in length and 10 ft/3.05 m in width. It is bounded at \\\\neither end by the bowling creases and on either side by imaginary lines, on each side of the imaginary line joining the \\\\ncentres of the two middle stumps, each parallel to it and 5 ft/1.52 m from it. If the pitch is next to an artificial pitch \\\\nwhich is closer than 5 ft/1.52 m from the middle stumps, the pitch on that side will extend only to the junction of the \\\\ntwo surfaces. See clauses 8.1 (Description, width and pitching),  7.2 (The bowling crease) and Appendix C. \\\\n10 \\\\n6.2 Fitness of pitch for play \\\\nThe umpires shall be the sole judges of the fitness of the pitch for play. See clauses 2.7 (Fitness for play) and 2.8 \\\\n(Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable conditions). \\\\n6.3 Selection and preparation \\\\nBefore the match, the Ground Authority shall be responsible for the selection and preparation of the pitch. During the \\\\nmatch, the umpires shall control its use and maintenance. \\\\n6.3.1 The Ground Authority shall ensure that during the period prior to the start of play and during intervals, the \\\\npitch area shall be roped off so as to prevent unauthorised access. (The pitch area shall include an area at \\\\nleast 2 metres beyond the rectangle made by the crease markings at both ends of the pitch). \\\\n6.3.2 The fourth umpire shall ensure that, prior to the start of play and during any intervals, only authorised staff, \\\\nthe ICC match officials, players, team coaches and authorised television personnel shall be allowed access \\\\nto the pitch area. Such access shall be subject to the following limitations: \\\\n6.3.2.1 Only captains and team coaches may walk on the actual playing surface of the pitch area (outside \\\\nof the crease markings). \\\\n6.3.2.2 Access to the pitch area by television personnel shall be restricted to one camera crew (including \\\\none or two television commentators) of the official licensed television broadcaster(s) (but not news \\\\ncrews). \\\\n6.3.2.3 No spiked footwear shall be permitted. \\\\n6.3.2.4 No one shall be permitted to bounce a ball on the pitch, strike it with a bat or cause damage to the \\\\npitch in any other way. \\\\n6.3.2.5 Access shall not interfere with pitch preparation. \\\\n6.3.3 In the event of any dispute, the ICC Tournament Referee will rule and his ruling will be final. \\\\n6.4 Changing the pitch \\\\n6.4.1 If the on-field umpires decide that it is dangerous or unreasonable for play to continue on the match pitch, \\\\nthey shall stop play and immediately advise the ICC Tournament Referee. \\\\n6.4.2 The on-field umpires and the ICC Tournament Referee shall then consult with both captains. \\\\n6.4.3 If the captains agree to continue, play shall resume. \\\\n6.4.4 If the decision is not to resume play, the on-field umpires together with the ICC Tournament Referee shall \\\\nconsider whether the existing pitch can be repaired and the match resumed from the point it was stopped. In \\\\nconsidering whether to authorise such repairs, the ICC Tournament Referee must consider whether this \\\\nwould place either side at an unfair advantage, given the play that had already taken place on the \\\\ndangerous pitch. \\\\n6.4.5 If the decision is that the existing pitch cannot be repaired, then the match is to be abandoned with the \\\\nfollowing consequences:  \\\\n6.4.5.1 In the event of the required number of overs to constitute a match having been completed at the \\\\ntime the match is abandoned, the result shall be determined according to the provisions of clause \\\\n16.4.2. \\\\n6.4.5.2 In the event of the required number of overs to constitute a match not having been completed, the \\\\nmatch will be abandoned as a no result. \\\\n6.5 Non-turf pitches \\\\nAll matches shall be played on natural turf pitches. \\\\nNote: Prior to the commencement of the series the participating Member Boards may agree to, and then seek the \\\\napproval of, ICC to use a hybrid pitch as an alternate to a natural turf pitch. \\\\n11 \\\\nThe use of PVA and other adhesives in the preparation of pitches is not permitted. \\\\n6.6 Junior Cricket \\\\nShall not apply. \\\\n7 THE CREASES \\\\n7.1 The creases \\\\nThe positions of a bowling crease, a popping crease and two return creases shall be marked by white lines, as set \\\\nout in clauses 7.2, 7.3 and 7.4, at each end of the pitch. See paragraph 1 of Appendix C. \\\\n7.2 The bowling crease \\\\nThe bowling crease, which is the back edge of the crease marking, is the line that marks the end of the pitch, as in \\\\nclause 6.1 (Area of pitch). It shall be 8 ft 8 in/2.64 m in length. \\\\n7.3 The popping crease \\\\nThe popping crease, which is the back edge of the crease marking, shall be in front of and parallel to the bowling \\\\ncrease and shall be 4 ft/1.22 m from it. The popping crease shall be marked to a minimum of 15 yards/13.71 m on \\\\neither side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps and shall be considered to be unlimited \\\\nin length. \\\\n7.4 The return creases \\\\nThe return creases, which are the inside edges of the crease markings, shall be at right angles to the popping crease \\\\nat a distance of 4 ft 4 in/1.32 m either side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps. Each \\\\nreturn crease shall be marked from the popping crease to a minimum of 8 ft/2.44 m behind it and shall be considered \\\\nto be unlimited in length. \\\\n7.5 Additional Crease Markings \\\\nAs a guideline to the umpires for the calling of Wides on the offside, the crease markings detailed in paragraph 1 of \\\\nAppendix C may be marked in white at each end of the pitch. \\\\n8 THE WICKETS \\\\n8.1 Description, width and pitching \\\\nTwo sets of wickets shall be pitched opposite and parallel to each other in the centres of the bowling creases. Each \\\\nset shall be 9 in/22.86 cm wide and shall consist of three wooden stumps with two wooden bails on top. See \\\\nparagraph 2 of Appendix B. \\\\n8.2 Size of stumps \\\\nThe tops of the stumps shall be 28 in/71.12 cm above the playing surface and shall be dome shaped except for the \\\\nbail grooves. The portion of a stump above the playing surface shall be cylindrical apart from the domed top, with \\\\ncircular section of diameter not less than 1.38 in/3.50 cm nor more than 1.5 in/3.81 cm. See paragraph 2 of Appendix \\\\nB. \\\\nFor televised matches the Host Board may provide a slightly larger cylindrical stump to accommodate the stump \\\\ncamera. When the larger stump is used, all three stumps must be exactly the same size. \\\\n8.3 The bails \\\\n8.3.1 The bails, when in position on top of the stumps, \\\\n- shall not project more than 0.5 in/1.27 cm above them. \\\\n- shall fit between the stumps without forcing them out of the vertical. \\\\n12 \\\\n8.3.2 Each bail shall conform to the following specifications. See paragraph 2 of Appendix B. \\\\nOverall length 4.31 in/10.95 cm \\\\nLength of barrel 2.13 in /5.40 cm \\\\nLonger spigot 1.38 in/3.50 cm \\\\nShorter spigot 0.81 in/2.06 cm. \\\\n8.3.3 The two spigots and the barrel shall have the same center line. \\\\n8.3.4 Devices aimed at protecting player safety by limiting the distance that a bail can travel off the stumps will be \\\\nallowed, subject to the approval of the Host Board and the ICC. \\\\n8.4 Dispensing with bails \\\\nThe umpires may agree to dispense with the use of bails, if necessary. If they so agree then no bails shall be used at \\\\neither end. The use of bails shall be resumed as soon as conditions permit. See clause 29.5 (Dispensing with bails). \\\\n8.5 LED Wickets \\\\nLED Wickets will not be used.  \\\\n9 PREPARATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE PLAYING \\\\nAREA \\\\n9.1 Rolling \\\\nThe pitch shall not be rolled during the match except as permitted in clauses 9.1.1 and 9.1.2. \\\\n9.1.1 Frequency and duration of rolling \\\\nDuring the match the pitch may be rolled at the request of the captain of the side batting second, for a period \\\\nof not more than 7 minutes, before the start of the second innings. \\\\n9.1.2 Rolling after a delayed start \\\\nIn addition to the rolling permitted above, if, after the toss and before the first innings of the match, the start \\\\nis delayed, the captain of the batting side may request that the pitch be rolled for not more than 7 minutes. \\\\nHowever, if the umpires together agree that the delay has had no significant effect on the state of the pitch, \\\\nthey shall refuse such request for rolling of the pitch. \\\\n9.1.3 Choice of rollers \\\\nIf there is more than one roller available the captain of the batting side shall choose which one is to be used. \\\\nThe following shall apply in addition to clause 9.1: \\\\n9.1.4 Prior to the scheduled time for the toss, the artificial drying of the pitch and outfield shall be at the discretion \\\\nof the Ground Authority. Thereafter and throughout the match the drying of the outfield may be undertaken \\\\nat any time by the Ground Authority, but the drying of the affected area of the pitch shall be carried out only \\\\non the instructions and under the supervision of the umpires. The umpires shall be empowered to have the \\\\npitch dried without reference to the captains at any time they are of the opinion that it is unfit for play. \\\\n9.1.5 The umpires may instruct the Ground Authority to use any available equipment, including any roller for the \\\\npurpose of drying the pitch and making it fit for play. \\\\n9.1.6 An absorbent roller may be used to remove water from the covers including the cover on the match pitch. \\\\n9.2 Clearing debris from the pitch \\\\n9.2.1 The pitch shall be cleared of any debris \\\\n13 \\\\n9.2.1.1 between innings. This shall precede rolling if any is to take place. \\\\n9.2.1.2 at all intervals for meals. \\\\n9.2.2 The clearance of debris in clause 9.2.1 shall be done by sweeping, except where the umpires consider that \\\\nthis may be detrimental to the surface of the pitch. In this case the debris must be cleared from that area by \\\\nhand, without sweeping. \\\\n9.2.3 In addition to 9.2.1, debris may be cleared from the pitch by hand, without sweeping, before mowing and \\\\nwhenever either umpire considers it necessary. \\\\n9.3 Mowing \\\\n9.3.1 Responsibility for mowing \\\\n9.3.1.1 All mowings which are carried out before the match shall be the sole responsibility of the Ground \\\\nAuthority. \\\\n9.4 Watering the pitch \\\\nThe pitch shall not be watered during the match. \\\\n9.5 Re-marking creases \\\\nCreases shall be re-marked whenever either umpire considers it necessary. \\\\n9.6 Maintenance of footholes \\\\nThe umpires shall ensure that the holes made by the bowlers and batters are cleaned out and dried whenever \\\\nnecessary to facilitate play. \\\\nThe umpires shall allow, if necessary, the returfing of footholes made by the bowlers in their delivery strides, or the \\\\nuse of quick-setting fillings for the same purpose. \\\\nIn addition, the umpires shall see that wherever possible and whenever it is considered necessary, action is taken \\\\nduring all intervals in play to do whatever is practicable to improve the bowler’s footholes.  \\\\n9.7 Securing of footholds and maintenance of pitch \\\\nDuring play, umpires shall allow the players to secure their footholds by the use of sawdust provided that no damage \\\\nto the pitch is caused and that clause 41 (Unfair play) is not contravened. \\\\n9.8 Protection and preparation of adjacent pitches during \\\\nmatches \\\\nThe protection (by way of an appropriate cover) and preparation of pitches which are adjacent to the match pitch will \\\\nbe permitted during the match subject to the following: \\\\n9.8.1 Such measures will only be possible if requested by the Ground Authority and approved by the umpires \\\\nbefore the start of the match. \\\\n9.8.2 Approval should only be granted where such measures are unavoidable and will not compromise the safety \\\\nof the players or their ability to execute their actions with complete freedom. \\\\n9.8.3 The preparation work shall be carried out under the supervision of the fourth umpire. \\\\n9.8.4 The consent of the captains is not required but the umpires shall advise both captains and the ICC \\\\nTournament Referee before the start of the match on what has been agreed. \\\\n14 \\\\n10 COVERING THE PITCH \\\\n10.1 Before the match \\\\nThe use of covers before the match is the responsibility of the Ground Authority and may include full covering if \\\\nrequired. \\\\nThe pitch shall be entirely protected against rain up to the commencement of play. \\\\nHowever, the Ground Authority shall grant suitable facility to the captains to inspect the pitch before the nomination of \\\\ntheir players and to the umpires to discharge their duties as laid down in clauses 2 (The umpires), 6 (The pitch), 7 \\\\n(The creases), 8 (The wickets), and 9 (Preparation and maintenance of the playing area). \\\\n10.2 During the match \\\\nThe pitch shall be entirely protected against rain up to the commencement of play, and for the duration of the period \\\\nof the match. \\\\nThe covers must totally protect the pitch and also the pitch surroundings, to a minimum of 5 metres either side of the \\\\npitch, and any worn or soft areas in the outfield. \\\\nThe bowlers’ run-ups shall be covered during inclement weather, in order to keep them dry, to a distance of at least \\\\n10 x 10 metres. \\\\n10.3 Removal of covers \\\\nAll covers (including “hessian” or “scrim” covers used to protect the pitch against the sun) shall be removed not later \\\\nthan 2 ½ hours before the scheduled start of play provided it is not raining at the time, but the pitch will be covered \\\\nagain if rain falls prior to the commencement of play. \\\\n11 INTERVALS \\\\n11.1 An interval \\\\n11.1.1 The following shall be classed as intervals. \\\\n- Intervals between innings. \\\\n- Intervals for meals. \\\\n- Intervals for drinks. \\\\n- Any other agreed interval. \\\\n11.1.2 Only these intervals shall be considered as scheduled breaks for the purposes of clause 24.2.6 (fielder \\\\nabsent or leaving the field of play). \\\\n11.2 Duration of interval \\\\n11.2.1 There shall be a 30 minute interval between innings, taken from the call of Time before the interval until the \\\\ncall of Play on resumption after the interval. \\\\n11.3 Allowance for interval between innings \\\\nLaw 11.3 of the Laws of Cricket shall not apply. \\\\n11.4 Changing agreed times of intervals \\\\n11.4.1 If the innings of the team batting first is completed prior to the scheduled time for the interval, the interval \\\\nshall take place immediately and the innings of the team batting second will commence after the interval. \\\\n15 \\\\nNote:   The prescribed interval timings above may be reduced by the ICC Tournament Referee taking into \\\\naccount the intention of not having a prolonged interval after a lengthy interruption close to the conclusion of \\\\nthe innings of the team batting first. However, the minimum interval shall not be less than 10 minutes.  \\\\n11.5 Intervals for drinks \\\\n11.5.1 Two drinks breaks per session shall be permitted, each 1 hour 10 minutes apart. Under conditions of \\\\nextreme heat the umpires may permit extra intervals for drinks.  \\\\n11.5.2 An individual player may be given a drink either on the boundary edge or at the fall of a wicket, on the field, \\\\nprovided that no playing time is wasted. No other drinks shall be taken onto the field without the permission \\\\nof the umpires. Any player taking drinks onto the field shall be dressed in proper cricket attire (subject to the \\\\nwearing of bibs – refer to the note in clause 24.1.4). \\\\n11.6 Scorers to be informed \\\\nThe umpires shall ensure that the scorers are informed of all agreements about hours of play and intervals and of any \\\\nchanges made thereto as permitted under this clause. \\\\n12 START OF PLAY; CESSATION OF PLAY \\\\n12.1 Call of Play \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall call Play before the first ball of the match and on the resumption of play after any \\\\ninterval or interruption. \\\\n12.2 Call of Time \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall call Time, when the ball is dead, at the end of any session of play or as required by \\\\nthese Playing Conditions. See also clause 20.3 (Call of Over or Time). \\\\n12.3 Removal of bails \\\\nAfter the call of Time, the bails shall be removed from both wickets. \\\\n12.4 Starting a new over \\\\nAnother over shall always be started at any time during the match, unless an interval is to be taken in the \\\\ncircumstances set out in clause 12.5.2, if the umpire, walking at normal pace, has arrived at the position behind the \\\\nstumps at the bowler’s end before the time agreed for the next interval has been reached. \\\\n12.5 Completion of an over \\\\nOther than at the end of the match, \\\\n12.5.1 if the agreed time for an interval is reached during an over, the over shall be completed before the interval is \\\\ntaken, except as provided for in clause 12.5.2. \\\\n12.5.2 when less than 3 minutes remains before the time agreed for the next interval, the interval shall be taken \\\\nimmediately if \\\\n  either a batter is dismissed or retires or \\\\n  the players have occasion to leave the field \\\\nwhether this occurs during an over or at the end of an over. Except at the end of an innings, if an over is \\\\nthus interrupted it shall be completed on the resumption of play. \\\\n12.6 Conclusion of match \\\\n12.6.1 The match is concluded \\\\n12.6.1.1 as soon as a result as defined in clauses 16.1 to 16.5 (The result) is reached. \\\\n16 \\\\n12.6.1.2 as soon as the prescribed number of overs have been completed \\\\n12.6.2 The match is concluded if, without a conclusion having been reached under 12.6.1, the players leave the \\\\nfield for adverse conditions of ground, weather or light, or in exceptional circumstances, and no further play \\\\nis possible. \\\\n12.7 Hours of Play; Minimum Overs Requirement \\\\n12.7.1 To be determined by the Host Board subject to there being 2 sessions of 3.5 hours each, separated by a 30 \\\\nminute interval between innings.  \\\\nNote: The playing hours of matches scheduled to take place at venues where dew is likely to be a factor \\\\nshould be determined so as to ensure that the effect of any dew is minimised. \\\\n12.8 Minimum Over Rates \\\\n12.8.1 The minimum over rate to be achieved in ODI Matches shall be 14.28 overs per hour. \\\\n12.8.2 The actual over rate shall be calculated at the end of each innings by the umpires. \\\\n12.8.3 In calculating the actual over rate for the match, allowances will be given as follows: \\\\n12.8.3.1 The time lost as a result of treatment given to a player by an authorised medical personnel on the \\\\nfield of play; \\\\n12.8.3.2 The time lost as a result of a player being required to leave the field as a result of a serious injury; \\\\n12.8.3.3 The time taken for all third umpire referrals and consultations and any umpire or player reviews; \\\\n12.8.3.4 The time lost as a result of time wasting by the batting side; and \\\\n12.8.3.5 The time lost due to all other circumstances that are beyond the control of the fielding side. \\\\n12.8.4 In the event of any time allowances being granted to the fielding team under clause 12.8.3.4 above (time \\\\nwasting by batting team), then such time shall be deducted from the allowances granted to such batting \\\\nteam in the determination of its over rate. \\\\n12.8.5 If a batting team is bowled out within the time determined for that innings pursuant to these playing \\\\nconditions (taking into account all of the time allowances set out above), the fielding side shall be deemed to \\\\nhave complied with the required minimum over rate. \\\\n12.8.6 The current over rate of the fielding team (+/- overs compared to the minimum rate required), to be advised \\\\nby the 3rd umpire every 30 minutes as a minimum, shall be displayed on a scoreboard or replay screen. \\\\n13 INNINGS \\\\n13.1 Number of innings \\\\n13.1.1 A match shall be one innings for each side. \\\\n13.2 Alternate innings \\\\nEach side shall take their innings alternately. \\\\n13.3 Completed innings \\\\nA side’s innings is to be considered as completed if any of the following applies \\\\n13.3.1 the side is all out. \\\\n13.3.2 at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batter is \\\\navailable to come in. \\\\n13.3.3 the prescribed number of overs have been bowled to the batting side. \\\\n17 \\\\n13.4 The toss \\\\nThe captains shall toss a coin for the choice of innings, on the field of play and under the supervision of the ICC \\\\nTournament Referee, not earlier than 60 minutes, nor later than 15 minutes before the scheduled or any rescheduled \\\\ntime for the start of play. Note, however, the provisions of clause 1.3 (Captain). \\\\n13.5 Decision to be notified \\\\nAs soon as the toss is completed, the captain of the side winning the toss shall decide whether to bat or to field and \\\\nshall notify the opposing captain and the umpires of this decision. Once notified, the decision cannot be changed. \\\\n13.6 Duration of Match \\\\n13.6.1 All matches will consist of one innings per side, each innings being limited to a maximum of 50 overs. All \\\\nmatches shall be of one day’s scheduled duration.  \\\\n13.6.2 There shall be no reserve days allocated for any matches. \\\\n13.7 Length of Innings \\\\n13.7.1 Uninterrupted Matches. \\\\n13.7.1.1 Each team shall bat for 50 overs unless all out earlier.  \\\\n13.7.1.2 If the team fielding first fails to bowl the required number of overs by the scheduled time for \\\\ncessation of the first innings, play shall continue until the required number of overs has been \\\\nbowled.  Subject to clause 11.4, the interval shall be fixed at 30 minutes. The team batting second \\\\nshall receive its full quota of 50 overs irrespective of the number of overs it bowled in the scheduled \\\\ntime for the cessation of the first innings.  \\\\n13.7.1.3 If the team batting first is dismissed in less than 50 overs, the team batting second shall be entitled \\\\nto bat for 50 overs.  \\\\n13.7.1.4 If the team fielding second fails to bowl 50 overs by the scheduled cessation time, the hours of play \\\\nshall be extended until the required number of overs has been bowled or a result is achieved.  \\\\n13.7.1.5 Penalties shall apply for slow over rates (refer to the ICC Code of Conduct). \\\\n13.7.2 Delayed or Interrupted Matches  \\\\n13.7.2.1 Delay or Interruption to the Innings of the Team Batting First  \\\\n13.7.2.1.1 When playing time has been lost the revised number of overs to be bowled in the \\\\nmatch shall be based on a rate of 14.28 overs per hour, which is inclusive of the \\\\nprovision of drinks intervals, in the total remaining time available for play. \\\\n13.7.2.1.2 The revision of the number of overs should ensure, whenever possible, that both \\\\nteams have the opportunity of batting for the same number of overs. The team \\\\nbatting second shall not bat for a greater number of overs than the first team unless \\\\nthe latter completed its innings in less than its allocated overs. To constitute a \\\\nmatch, a minimum of 20 overs have to be bowled to the side batting second, \\\\nsubject to a result not being achieved earlier. \\\\n13.7.2.1.3 As soon as the total minutes of playing time remaining is less than the completed \\\\novers faced by Team 1 multiplied by 4.2, then the first innings is terminated and the \\\\nprovisions of 13.7.2.2 below take effect. \\\\n13.7.2.1.4 A fixed time will be specified for the commencement of the interval, and also the \\\\nclose of play for the match, by applying a rate of 14.28 overs per hour. When \\\\ncalculating the length of playing time available for the match, or the length of either \\\\ninnings, the timing and duration of all relative delays, extensions in playing hours, \\\\ninterruptions in play, and intervals, excluding those for drinks, will be taken into \\\\nconsideration. This calculation must not cause the match to finish earlier than the \\\\noriginal or rescheduled time for cessation of play on the final scheduled day for \\\\n18 \\\\nplay. If required the original time shall be extended to allow for one extra over for \\\\neach team.  \\\\n13.7.2.1.5 If the team fielding first fails to bowl the revised number of overs by the specified \\\\ntime, play shall continue until the required number of overs have been bowled or \\\\nthe innings is completed.  \\\\n13.7.2.1.6 Penalties shall apply for slow over rates (refer to the ICC Code of Conduct). \\\\n \\\\n13.7.2.2 Delay or Interruption to the innings of the Team Batting Second (see paragraph 2 of Appendix E) \\\\n13.7.2.2.1 When playing time has been lost and, as a result, it is not possible for the team \\\\nbatting second to have the opportunity of receiving its allocated, or revised \\\\nallocation of overs in the playing time available, the number of overs shall be \\\\nreduced at a rate of 14.28 overs per hour, which is inclusive of the provision of \\\\ndrinks intervals, in respect of the lost playing time. Should the calculations result in \\\\na fraction of an over the fraction shall be ignored.  \\\\n13.7.2.2.2 In addition, should the innings of the team batting first have been completed prior to \\\\nthe scheduled, or re-scheduled time for the commencement of the interval, then \\\\nany calculation relating to the revision of overs shall not be effective until an \\\\namount of time equivalent to that by which the second innings started early has \\\\nelapsed.  \\\\n13.7.2.2.3 To constitute a match, a minimum of 20 overs have to be bowled to the team \\\\nbatting second subject to a result not being achieved earlier. \\\\n13.7.2.2.4 The team batting second shall not bat for a greater number of overs than the first \\\\nteam unless the latter completed its innings in less than its allocated overs.  \\\\n13.7.2.2.5 A fixed time will be specified for the close of play by applying a rate of 14.28 overs \\\\nper hour. With the exception of drinks intervals, the timing and duration of all \\\\nrelative delays, extensions in playing hours and interruptions in play, will be taken \\\\ninto consideration in specifying this time.  \\\\n13.7.2.2.6 If the team fielding second fails to bowl the revised overs by the scheduled or re-\\\\nscheduled close of play, the hours of play shall be extended until the overs have \\\\nbeen bowled or a result achieved. \\\\n13.7.2.2.7 Penalties shall apply for slow over rates (refer to the ICC Code of Conduct). \\\\n13.7.3 Extra Time \\\\nIn all matches where the start of play is delayed or play is suspended, the scheduled hours of play shall be extended up to a \\\\nmaximum of 90 minutes depending on the prevailing light conditions in the Host Country. The amount of extra time to be \\\\nallowed must be communicated to the ICC 30 days prior to the start of the tri-series. \\\\n                                         13.8 Over-Rate Penalties \\\\n13.8.1 The fielding side shall be in position to bowl the first ball of the final over of the innings by the scheduled (or \\\\nre-scheduled) cessation time for the innings (calculated in accordance with clause 13.7). In delayed or interrupted \\\\nmatches where there has been a reduction of 3 or more overs pursuant to clause 13.7.2, the fielding side shall be in \\\\nposition to bowl the first ball of the penultimate over of the innings by the scheduled (or re-scheduled) cessation time \\\\nfor the innings. \\\\n13.8.2 Where this requirement is not met, clause 28.7.2.2.3 shall be varied and from the start of the next over after \\\\nthe point in time at which the cessation time is reached (and for the remainder of the innings) no more than 4 fielders \\\\nshall be permitted outside the fielding restriction area referred to in clause 28.7.2.1. \\\\n13.8.3 Clause 13.8.2 shall not apply where: \\\\n13.8.3.1 a side’s innings is reduced to less than 25 overs, unless the over-rate penalty has been applied prior to such \\\\nreduction; or \\\\n13.8.3.2 a side’s innings is completed prior to the scheduled (or re-scheduled) cessation time for the innings. \\\\n13.8.4 The bowler’s end umpire shall inform the captain of the fielding side, the batter and the other umpire of: \\\\n19 \\\\n13.8.4.1 the scheduled cessation time for the innings prior to the start of the innings, and of any re-scheduled \\\\ncessation time following any subsequent interruption to play; and \\\\n13.8.4.2 any time allowances pursuant to clause 12.8.3 as and when they arise. \\\\n13.8.5 Over-rate penalties pursuant to clause 13.8 shall be applied in addition to the relevant provisions under the \\\\nICC Code of Conduct. \\\\n13.8 Number of Overs per Bowler \\\\n13.8.1 No bowler shall bowl more than 10 overs in an innings.  \\\\n13.8.2 In a delayed or interrupted match where the overs are reduced for both teams or for the team bowling \\\\nsecond, no bowler may bowl more than one-fifth of the total overs allowed.  \\\\n13.8.3 Where the total overs is not divisible by 5, one additional over shall be allowed to the maximum number per \\\\nbowler necessary to make up the balance.  \\\\n13.8.4 In the event of a bowler breaking down and being unable to complete an over, the remaining balls will be \\\\nallowed by another bowler. Such part of an over will count as a full over only in so far as each bowler’s limit \\\\nis concerned.  \\\\n13.8.5 The scoreboard shall show the total number of overs bowled and the number of overs bowled by each \\\\nbowler.  \\\\n14 THE FOLLOW-ON \\\\nShall not apply. \\\\n15 DECLARATION AND FORFEITURE \\\\nShall not apply. \\\\n16 THE RESULT \\\\n16.1 A Win – one-innings match \\\\n16.1.1 Unless the winner is determined by DLS (see clause 16.4), the side which has scored in its one innings a \\\\ntotal of runs in excess of that scored by the opposing side in its one completed innings shall win the match. \\\\nSee clause 13.3 (Completed innings). Note also clause 16.5 (Winning hit or extras). \\\\n16.1.2 Save for circumstances where a match is awarded to a team as a consequence of the opposing team’s \\\\nrefusal to play (clause 16.2), a result can be achieved only if both teams have had the opportunity of batting \\\\nfor at least 20 overs, unless one team has been all out in less than 20 overs or unless the team batting \\\\nsecond scores enough runs to win in less than 20 overs. \\\\n16.1.3 Save for circumstances where a match is awarded to a team as a consequence of the opposing team’s \\\\nrefusal to play (clause 16.2), all matches in which both teams have not had an opportunity of batting for a \\\\nminimum of 20 overs, shall be declared a No Result. \\\\n16.2 ICC Tournament Referee awarding a match \\\\n16.2.1 A match shall be lost by a side which either \\\\n16.2.1.1 concedes defeat or \\\\n16.2.1.2 in the opinion of the ICC Tournament Referee refuses to play and the ICC Tournament Referee \\\\nshall award the match to the other side. \\\\n16.2.2 If an umpire considers that an action by any player or players might constitute a refusal by either side to play \\\\nthen the umpires together shall inform the ICC Tournament Referee of this fact. The ICC Tournament \\\\nReferee shall together with the umpires ascertain the cause of the action. If the ICC Tournament Referee, \\\\n20 \\\\nafter due consultation with the umpires, then decides that this action does constitute a refusal to play by one \\\\nside, he/she shall so inform the captain of that side. If the captain persists in the action the ICC Tournament \\\\nReferee shall award the match in accordance with clause 16.2.1.2 above. \\\\n16.2.3 If action as in clause 16.2.2 above takes place after play has started and does not constitute a refusal to \\\\nplay the delay or interruption in play shall be dealt with in the same manner as provided for in clauses 13.7.2 \\\\n(Delayed and Interrupted Matches) and 11.4 (Changing agreed times for intervals) above. \\\\nNote: In addition to the consequences of any refusal to play prescribed under this clause, any such \\\\nrefusal, whether temporary or final, may result in disciplinary action being taken against the captain and \\\\nteam responsible under the ICC Code of Conduct. \\\\n16.3 All other matches – A Tie or No Result \\\\n16.3.1 A Tie \\\\n16.3.1.1 If the teams’ scores are equal after both innings have been completed (if applicable under DLS – \\\\nsee clause 16.4), then a Super Over shall be played. If the Super Over is a tie, then unless \\\\nexceptional circumstances arise (see paragraph 25 of Appendix G) subsequent Super Overs shall \\\\nbe played until there is a winner. Should it not be possible to play or to complete the Super Overs \\\\nneeded to determine a winner, the match shall be tied. \\\\n16.3.1.2  \\\\n16.3.1.3 No Result \\\\nSee clause 16.1.3 above. \\\\n16.4 Calculation of the Target Score \\\\n16.4.1 Interrupted Matches \\\\n16.4.1.1 If, due to suspension of play after the start of the match, the number of overs in the innings of either \\\\nteam has to be revised to a lesser number than originally allotted (minimum of 20 overs), then a \\\\nrevised target score (to win) should be set for the number of overs which the team batting second \\\\nwill have the opportunity of facing. This revised target is to be calculated using DLS. The target set \\\\nwill always be a whole number and one run less will constitute a Tie. \\\\n16.4.2 Prematurely Terminated Matches \\\\n16.4.2.1 If the innings of the side batting second is suspended (with at least 20 overs bowled) and it is not \\\\npossible for the match to be resumed, the match will be decided by comparison with the DLS ‘Par \\\\nScore’ determined at the instant of the suspension using DLS. If the score is equal to the par score, \\\\nthe match is a Tie. Otherwise the result is a victory, or defeat, by the margin of runs by which the \\\\nscore exceeds, or falls short of, the Par Score. \\\\n16.5 Winning hit or extras \\\\n16.5.1 As soon as a result is reached as defined in clauses 16.1, 16.2 or 16.3.1, the match is at an end. Nothing \\\\nthat happens thereafter, except as in clause 41.17 (Penalty runs), shall be regarded as part of it. Note also \\\\nclause 16.8. \\\\n16.5.2 The side batting last will have scored enough runs to win only if its total of runs is sufficient without including \\\\nany runs completed by the batters before the completion of a catch, or the obstruction of a catch, from which \\\\nthe striker could be dismissed. \\\\n16.5.3 If a boundary is scored before the batters have completed sufficient runs to win the match, the whole of the \\\\nboundary allowance shall be credited to the side’s total and, in the case of a hit by the bat, to the striker’s \\\\nscore. \\\\n21 \\\\n16.6 Statement of result \\\\nIf the side batting last wins the match without losing all its wickets, the result shall be stated as a win by the number of \\\\nwickets still then to fall, unless clause 16.4.2.1 (Prematurely Terminated Matches – Calculation of the Target Score) \\\\napplies. \\\\nIf, without having scored a total of runs in excess of the total scored by the opposing side, the innings of the side \\\\nbatting last has been completed, but as the result of an award of 5 Penalty runs its total of runs is then sufficient to \\\\nwin, the result shall be stated as a win to that side by Penalty runs. \\\\nIf the side fielding last wins the match, the result shall be stated as a win by runs. \\\\nIf the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as Match \\\\nConceded or Match Awarded, as the case may be. \\\\n16.7 Correctness of result \\\\nAny decision as to the correctness of the scores shall be the responsibility of the umpires. See clause 2.15 \\\\n(Correctness of scores). \\\\n16.8 Mistakes in scoring \\\\nIf, after the players and umpires have left the field in the belief that the match has been concluded, the umpires \\\\ndiscover that a mistake in scoring has occurred which affects the result then, subject to clause 16.9, they shall adopt \\\\nthe following procedure. \\\\n16.8.1 If, when the players leave the field, the side batting last has not completed its innings and; a) either the \\\\nnumber of overs to be bowled in that innings has not been completed, or b) the end of the innings has not \\\\nbeen reached, then, unless one side concedes defeat, the umpires shall order play to resume. \\\\nUnless a result is reached sooner, play will then continue, if conditions permit, until the prescribed number of \\\\novers has been completed. The number of overs shall be taken as they were at the call of Time for the \\\\nsupposed conclusion of the match. No account shall be taken of the time between that moment and the \\\\nresumption of play. \\\\n16.8.2 If, at this call of Time, the overs have been completed and no Playing time remains, or if the side batting last \\\\nhas completed its innings, the umpires shall immediately inform both captains of the necessary corrections \\\\nto the scores and to the result. \\\\n16.9 Result not to be changed \\\\nOnce the umpires have agreed with the scorers the correctness of the scores at the conclusion of the match – see \\\\nclauses 2.15 (Correctness of scores) and 3.2 (Correctness of scores) – the result cannot thereafter be changed. \\\\n16.10 Points  \\\\n16.10.1 The points system will be as follows: \\\\nWin                                      2  \\\\nTie, No Result or abandoned 1  \\\\nLoss                  0 \\\\nIf, at the end of the competition, teams finish on equal points, the order of teams will be determined in the \\\\nfollowing order or priority:  \\\\n- The team with the most number of wins throughout the competition. \\\\n- If still equal, the team with the highest net run rate in all matches throughout the competition.  \\\\n- If the above does not resolve the ordering and there are teams that are still equal, the teams \\\\nwill be ordered as per the seeding at the beginning of the competition.  \\\\n- If all Matches produce a no result, the Teams will be ordered as per their original CWC League \\\\n2 seeding, and the top 4 seeded teams will progress to the ICC Men’s CWC Qualifier. \\\\n22 \\\\n \\\\nIn a match declared as a No Result, run rate is not applicable.  \\\\n16.10.2 The competition format \\\\nThe ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 will be contested by the following eight teams.  \\\\n1. Netherlands  \\\\n2. Scotland \\\\n3. Oman \\\\n4. Nepal  \\\\n5. Namibia \\\\n6. United States of America \\\\n7. United Arab Emirates \\\\n8. Canada  \\\\nThe teams have been seeded based on finishing positio ns after completion of the most recent  editions of the  ICC \\\\nMen’s Cricket World Cup League 2. Netherlands are top seeds due to having dropped into League 2 from t he now \\\\ndiscontinued Cricket World Cup Super League. \\\\nTeams will take part in a total of 24 tri-series with each team hosting three home series. A total of 144 matches will be \\\\nplayed with each team playing a total of 36 matches throughout the competition.  \\\\n \\\\nThe top four teams at the conclusion of the competition gain automatic qualification to play in the ICC CWC Qualifier \\\\nin 2027. The bottom four teams play in the ICC CWC Qualifier Playoff also to be played in 2027. The bottom four will \\\\nbe joined in the Playoff by  the top four teams from the Challenge League. At the conclusion of the Cricket World Cup \\\\nPlayoff, the top four teams from the Playoff will proceed to the ICC CWC Qualifier.  \\\\n  \\\\n16.10.3 Net Run Rate  \\\\nA team’s net run rate is calculated by deducting from the average runs per over scored by that team \\\\nthroughout the competition, the average runs per over scored against that team throughout the competition.  \\\\nIn the event of a team being all out in less than its full quota of overs, the calculation of its net run rate shall \\\\nbe based on the full quota of overs to which it would have been entitled and not on the number of overs in \\\\nwhich the team was dismissed.  \\\\nOnly those matches where results are achieved will count for the purpose of net run rate calculations. Where \\\\na match is abandoned, but a result is achieved under Duckworth/Lewis/Stern, for net run rate purposes \\\\nTeam 1 will be credited with Team 2’s Par Score on abandonment off the same number of overs faced by \\\\nTeam 2.Where a match is concluded with Duckworth/Lewis/Stern having been applied at an earlier point in \\\\nthe match, Team 1 will be credited with 1 run less than the final Target Score for Team 2 off the total number \\\\nof overs allocated to Team 2 to reach the target.  \\\\n17 THE OVER \\\\n17.1 Number of balls \\\\nThe ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 valid balls. \\\\n17.2 Start of an over \\\\nAn over has started when the bowler starts his run-up or, if there is no run-up, starts his action for the first delivery of \\\\nthat over. \\\\n17.3 Validity of balls \\\\n17.3.1 A ball shall not count as one of the 6 balls of the over unless it is delivered, even though, as in clause 38.3 \\\\n(Non-striker leaving his ground early) a batter may be dismissed or some other incident occurs without the \\\\nball having been delivered. \\\\n17.3.2 A ball delivered by the bowler shall not count as one of the 6 balls of the over \\\\n23 \\\\n17.3.2.1 if it is called dead, or is to be considered dead, before the striker has had an opportunity to play it. \\\\nSee clause 20.7 (Dead ball; ball counting as one of over). \\\\n17.3.2.2 if it is called dead in the circumstances of clause 20.4.2.6. Note also the special provisions of clause \\\\n20.4.2.5 (Umpire calling and signaling Dead ball) \\\\n17.3.2.3 if it is a No ball. See clause 21 (No ball). \\\\n17.3.2.4 if it is a Wide. See clause 22 (Wide ball). \\\\n17.3.2.5 when any of clauses 24.4 (Player returning without permission), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 41.4 \\\\n(Deliberate attempt to distract striker), or 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of \\\\nbatter) is applied. \\\\n17.3.3 Any deliveries other than those listed in clauses 17.3.1 and 17.3.2 shall be known as valid balls. Only valid \\\\nballs shall count towards the 6 balls of the over. \\\\n17.4 Call of Over \\\\nWhen 6 valid balls have been bowled and when the ball becomes dead, the umpire shall call Over before leaving the \\\\nwicket. See also clause 20.3 (Call of Over or Time). \\\\n17.5 Umpire miscounting \\\\n17.5.1 If the umpire miscounts the number of valid balls, the over as counted by the umpire shall stand. \\\\n17.5.2 If, having miscounted, the umpire allows an over to continue after 6 valid balls have been bowled, he/she \\\\nmay subsequently call Over when the ball becomes dead after any delivery, even if that delivery is not a \\\\nvalid ball. \\\\n17.5.3 Whenever possible, the third umpire shall liaise with the scorers and if possible inform the on-field umpires if \\\\nthe over has been miscounted. \\\\n17.6 Bowler changing ends \\\\nA bowler shall be allowed to change ends as often as desired, provided he does not bowl two overs consecutively, \\\\nnor bowl parts of each of two consecutive overs, in the same innings. \\\\n17.7 Finishing an over \\\\n17.7.1 Other than at the end of an innings, a bowler shall finish an over in progress unless incapacitated or \\\\nsuspended under these Playing Conditions. \\\\n17.7.2 If for any reason, other than the end of an innings, an over is left uncompleted at the start of an interval or \\\\ninterruption, it shall be completed on resumption of play. \\\\n17.8 Bowler incapacitated or suspended during an over \\\\nIf for any reason a bowler is incapacitated while running up to deliver the first ball of an over, or is incapacitated or \\\\nsuspended during an over, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball.  If a bowler is incapacitated or suspended \\\\nduring an over, another bowler shall complete the over from the same end, provided that he does not bowl two overs \\\\nconsecutively, nor bowl parts of each of two consecutive overs, in that innings. \\\\n18 SCORING RUNS \\\\n18.1 A run \\\\nThe score shall be reckoned by runs. A run is scored \\\\n18.1.1 so often as the batters, at any time while the ball is in play, have crossed and made good their ground from \\\\nend to end. \\\\n18.1.2 when a boundary is scored. See clause 19 (Boundaries). \\\\n24 \\\\n18.1.3 when Penalty runs are awarded. See clause 18.6. \\\\n18.2 Runs disallowed and runs not scored \\\\nWherever in these Playing Conditions provision is made for the scoring of runs or awarding of penalties, such runs \\\\nand penalties will be subject to any provisions that may be applicable for a run to be disallowed or a run not to be \\\\nscored (see Appendix A 11) or for the non-award of penalties. \\\\nWhen runs are disallowed, the one run penalty for No ball or Wide shall stand and 5 run penalties shall be allowed, \\\\nexcept for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side). \\\\n18.3 Short runs \\\\n18.3.1 A run is short if a batter fails to make good his ground in turning for a further run. \\\\n18.3.2 Although a short run shortens the succeeding one, the latter if completed shall not be regarded as short. A \\\\nstriker setting off for the first run from in front of the popping crease may do so also without penalty. \\\\n18.4 Unintentional short runs \\\\nExcept in the circumstances of clause 18.5, \\\\n18.4.1 if either batter runs a short run, the umpire concerned shall, unless a boundary is scored, call and signal \\\\nShort run as soon as the ball becomes dead and that run shall not be scored.  \\\\n18.4.2 if, after either or both batters run short, a boundary is scored the umpire concerned shall disregard the short \\\\nrunning and shall not call or signal Short run, unless the boundary is a result of an overthrow or willful act of \\\\na fielder (see clause 19.8 – Overthrow or willful act of fielder). \\\\n18.4.3 if both batters run short in one and the same run, this shall be regarded as only one short run. \\\\n18.4.4 if more than one run is short then, subject to clauses 18.4.2 and 18.4.3, all runs called as short shall not be \\\\nscored. \\\\n18.4.5 if there has been more than one short run, the umpire shall inform the scorers as to the number of runs to be \\\\nrecorded. \\\\n18.5 Deliberate short runs \\\\n18.5.1 If either umpire considers that one or both batters deliberately ran short at that umpire’s end, the umpire \\\\nconcerned shall, when the ball is dead, call and signal Short run and inform the other umpire of what has \\\\noccurred and apply clause 18.5.2. \\\\n18.5.2 The bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\\\n- return any not out batter to his original end \\\\n- signal No ball or Wide to the scorers, if applicable \\\\n- repeat the Short run signal to the scorers \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side \\\\n- award any other 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective \\\\nhelmets belonging to the fielding side) \\\\n- inform the scorers as to the number of runs to be recorded, and \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the \\\\nreason for this action. \\\\n25 \\\\n18.6 Runs awarded for penalties \\\\nRuns shall be awarded for penalties under clauses 18.5 (Deliberate short runs), 21 (No ball), 22 (Wide ball), 24.4 \\\\n(Player returning without permission), 26.4 (Penalties for contravention), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 28.3 (Protective \\\\nhelmets belonging to the fielding side) 41 (Unfair play) and 42 (Players’ conduct). Note, however, the restrictions on \\\\nthe award of Penalty runs in clauses 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded), 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the \\\\nfielding side) and 34 (Hit the ball twice). \\\\n18.7 Runs scored for boundaries \\\\nRuns shall be scored for boundary allowances under clause 19 (Boundaries). \\\\n18.8 Runs scored when a batter is dismissed \\\\nWhen a batter is dismissed, any runs for penalties awarded to either side shall stand. \\\\nNo other runs shall be credited to the batting side, except as follows. \\\\n18.8.1 If a batter is dismissed Obstructing the field, the batting side shall also score any runs completed before the \\\\noffence. \\\\nIf, however, the obstruction or distraction prevented a catch being made, no runs other than penalties shall \\\\nbe scored. \\\\n18.8.2 If a batter is dismissed Run out, the batting side shall also score any runs completed before the wicket was  \\\\nfairly broken. \\\\n18.9 Runs scored when the ball becomes dead other than at the \\\\nfall of a wicket \\\\nWhen the ball becomes dead for any reason other than the fall of a wicket, or is called dead by an umpire, unless \\\\nthere is specific provision otherwise in these Playing Conditions, any runs for penalties awarded to either side shall \\\\nbe scored. Note however the provisions of clauses 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded) and 28.3 (Protective helmets \\\\nbelonging to the fielding side). \\\\nAdditionally the batting side shall be credited with all runs completed by the batters before the incident or call of Dead \\\\nball and the run in progress if the batters had already crossed at the instant of the incident or call of Dead ball. Note \\\\nspecifically, however, the provisions of clause 41.5.8 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter). \\\\n18.10 Crediting of runs scored \\\\nUnless stated otherwise in these Playing Conditions, \\\\n18.10.1 if the ball is struck by the bat, all runs scored by the batting side shall be credited to the striker, except for \\\\nthe following: \\\\n- an award of 5 Penalty runs, which shall be scored as Penalty runs \\\\n- the one run penalty for a No ball, which shall be scored as a No ball extra. \\\\n18.10.2 if the ball is not struck by the bat, runs shall be scored as Penalty runs, Byes, Leg byes, No ball extras or \\\\nWides as the case may be. If Byes or Leg byes accrue from a No ball, only the one run penalty for No ball \\\\nshall be scored as such, and the remainder as Byes or Leg byes as appropriate. \\\\n18.10.3 the bowler shall be debited with: \\\\n- all runs scored by the striker \\\\n- all runs scored as No ball extras \\\\n- all runs scored as Wides. \\\\n26 \\\\n18.11 Batter returning to original end \\\\n18.11.1 When the striker is dismissed in any of the circumstances in clauses 18.11.1.1 to 18.11.1.57, the not out \\\\nbatter shall return to his original end. \\\\n18.11.1.1 Bowled. \\\\n18.11.1.2 Stumped. \\\\n18.11.1.3 Hit the ball twice. \\\\n18.11.1.4 LBW. \\\\n18.11.1.5 Hit wicket. \\\\n18.11.1.6 Caught \\\\n18.11.1.7 Obstructing the field, where the obstruction or distraction prevents the striker being out caught. \\\\n18.11.2 The batters shall return to their original ends in any of the cases of clauses 18.11.2.1 to 18.11.2.3. \\\\n18.11.2.1 A boundary is scored unless as a result of an overthrow or willful act of a fielder (see clause 19.8). \\\\n18.11.2.2 Runs are disallowed for any reason. \\\\n18.11.2.3  the batters at the wicket decide to do so, under clause 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or \\\\nobstruction of batter). \\\\n18.12 Batter returning to wicket he has left \\\\n18.12.1 When a batter is dismissed in any of the ways in clauses 18.12.11 to 18.12.1.2, the not out batter shall \\\\nreturn to the wicket he has left but only if the batters had not already crossed at the instant of the incident \\\\ncausing the dismissal. If runs are to be disallowed, however, the not out batter shall return to his original \\\\nend. \\\\n18.12.1.1 Obstructing the field, where the obstruction or distraction does not prevent the striker being out \\\\nCaught. \\\\n18.12.1.2 Run out. \\\\n18.12.2 If, while a run is in progress, the ball becomes dead for any reason other than the dismissal of a batter, the \\\\nbatters shall return to the wickets they had left, but only if they had not already crossed in running when the \\\\nball became dead. If, however, any of the circumstances of clauses 18.11.2.1 to 18.11.2.3 apply, the batters \\\\nshall return to their original ends. \\\\n19 BOUNDARIES \\\\n19.1 Determining the boundary of the field of play \\\\n19.1.1 Before the toss, the umpires shall determine the boundary of the field of play, which shall be fixed for the \\\\nduration of the match. See clause 2.3.42 (Consultation with Host Board). \\\\n19.1.2 The boundary shall be determined such that no part of any sight-screen, will, at any stage of the match, be \\\\nwithin the field of play. \\\\n19.1.3 The aim shall be to maximize the size of the playing area at each venue. With respect to the size of the \\\\nboundaries, no boundary shall be longer than 90 yards (82.29 meters), and no boundary should be shorter \\\\nthan 65 yards (59.43 metres) from the centre of the pitch to be used. \\\\n19.1.4 At all times, there must be 3 yards (2.74 meters) from the boundary rope to the first solid object (advertising \\\\nboards/LEDs, photographers, cameramen, dug outs, covers, perimeter fence) for the player’s safety run off. \\\\n19.1.5    If the boundary is positioned less than 90 yards (82.29 meters) from the centre of the pitch, the boundary \\\\nrope cannot be set at a distance of more than 10 yards (9.14 meters) from the perimeter fence. The 10 \\\\nyards shall be inclusive of the 3 yards (2.74 meters) provided for the player’s safety run off. \\\\n27 \\\\n19.1.6    Any ground which has previously been approved to host international cricket which is unable to conform to \\\\nthe minimum boundary dimension shall be exempt. In such cases the boundary shall be positioned so as to \\\\nmaximize the size of the playing area. \\\\n19.2 Identifying and marking the boundary \\\\n19.2.1 All boundaries must be designated by a rope, or similar object of a minimum standard as authorised by the \\\\nICC from time to time.  \\\\n19.2.2 If the boundary is marked by means of an object that is in contact with the ground the boundary will be the \\\\nedge of the grounded part of the object which is nearest the pitch. \\\\n19.2.3 An obstacle within the field of play shall not be regarded as a boundary unless so determined by the umpires \\\\nbefore the toss. See clause 2.3.4 (Consultation with Host Board). \\\\n19.2.4 If an unauthorised person enters the playing arena and handles the ball, the umpire at the bowler’s end shall \\\\nbe the sole judge of whether the boundary allowance should be scored or the ball be treated as still in play \\\\nor called dead ball if a batter is liable to be out as a result of the unauthorised person handling the ball. See \\\\nalso clause 20.4.2.12 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball). \\\\n19.3 Restoring the boundary \\\\nIf a solid object used to mark the boundary is disturbed for any reason, then: \\\\n19.3.1 the boundary shall be considered to be in its original position. \\\\n19.3.2 the object shall be returned to its original position as soon as is practicable; if play is taking place, this shall \\\\nbe as soon as the ball is dead. \\\\n19.3.3 if some part of a fence or other marker has come within the field of play, that part shall be removed from the \\\\nfield of play as soon as is practicable; if play is taking place, this shall be as soon as the ball is dead. \\\\n19.4 Ball grounded beyond the boundary \\\\n19.4.1 The ball in play is grounded beyond the boundary if it touches \\\\n- the boundary or any part of an object used to mark the boundary; \\\\n- the ground beyond the boundary; \\\\n- any object that is grounded beyond the boundary. \\\\n19.4.2 The ball in play is to be regarded as being grounded beyond the boundary if \\\\n- a fielder, grounded beyond the boundary as in clause 19.5, touches the ball; \\\\n- a fielder, after catching the ball within the boundary, becomes grounded beyond the boundary while in \\\\ncontact with the ball, before completing the catch. \\\\n19.5 Fielder grounded beyond the boundary \\\\n19.5.1 A fielder is grounded beyond the boundary if some part of his person is in contact with any of the following: \\\\n- the boundary or any part of an object used to mark the boundary; \\\\n- the ground beyond the boundary; \\\\n- any object that is in contact with the ground beyond the boundary; \\\\n- another fielder who is grounded beyond the boundary. \\\\n19.5.2 A fielder who is not in contact with the ground is considered to be grounded beyond the boundary if his final \\\\ncontact with the ground, before his first contact with the ball after it has been delivered by the bowler, was \\\\nnot entirely within the boundary. \\\\n28 \\\\n19.6 Boundary allowances \\\\n19.6.1 6 runs shall be allowed for a boundary 6; and 4 runs for a boundary 4. See also clause 19.7. \\\\n19.7 Runs scored from boundaries \\\\n19.7.1 A boundary 6 will be scored if and only if the ball has been struck by the bat and is first grounded beyond the \\\\nboundary without having been in contact with the ground within the field of play. This shall apply even if the \\\\nball has previously touched a fielder. \\\\n19.7.2 A boundary 4 will be scored when a ball that is grounded beyond the boundary \\\\n- whether struck by the bat or not, was first grounded within the boundary, or \\\\n- has not been struck by the bat. \\\\n19.7.3 When a boundary is scored, the batting side, except in the circumstances of clause 19.8, shall be awarded \\\\nwhichever is the greater of \\\\n19.7.3.1 the allowance for the boundary \\\\n19.7.3.2 the runs completed by the batters together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at \\\\nthe instant the boundary is scored. \\\\n19.7.4 When the runs in clause 19.7.3.2 exceed the boundary allowance they shall replace the boundary allowance \\\\nfor the purposes of clause 18.12.2. \\\\n19.7.5 The scoring of Penalty runs by either side is not affected by the scoring of a boundary. \\\\n19.8 Overthrow or willful act of fielder \\\\nIf the boundary results from an overthrow or from the willful act of a fielder, the runs scored shall be \\\\nany runs for penalties awarded to either side \\\\nand the allowance for the boundary \\\\nand the runs completed by the batters, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of \\\\nthe throw or act. \\\\nClause 18.12.2 (Batter returning to wicket he has left) shall apply as from the instant of the throw or act. \\\\n20 DEAD BALL \\\\n20.1 Ball is dead \\\\n20.1.1 The ball becomes dead when \\\\n20.1.1.1 it is finally settled in the hands of the wicket-keeper or of the bowler. \\\\n20.1.1.2 a boundary is scored. See clause 19.7 (Runs scored from boundaries). \\\\n20.1.1.3 a batter is dismissed. The ball will be deemed to be dead from the instant of the incident causing \\\\nthe dismissal. \\\\n20.1.1.4 whether played or not it becomes trapped between the bat and person of a batter or between items \\\\nof his clothing or equipment. \\\\n20.1.1.5 whether played or not it lodges in the clothing or equipment of a batter or the clothing of an umpire. \\\\n20.1.1.6 there is an award of Penalty runs under either of clauses 24.4 (Player returning without permission) \\\\nor 28.3 (Fielding the ball). The ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n20.1.1.7 there is a contravention of clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side). \\\\n20.1.1.8 the match is concluded in any of the ways stated in clause 12.6 (Conclusion of match). \\\\n29 \\\\n20.1.2 The ball shall be considered to be dead when it is clear to the bowler’s end umpire that the fielding side and \\\\nboth batters at the wicket have ceased to regard it as in play. \\\\n20.1.3 In a match where cameras are being used on or over the field of play (e.g. Spidercam), should a ball that \\\\nhas been hit by the batter make contact, while still in play, with the camera, its apparatus or its cable, either \\\\numpire shall call and signal ‘dead ball’. The ball shall not count as one of the over and no runs shall be \\\\nscored. If the delivery was called a No ball it shall count and the No ball penalty shall be applied. No other \\\\nruns (including penalty runs) apart from the No ball penalty shall be scored. \\\\n20.1.4 Should a ball thrown by a fielder make contact with a camera on or over the field of play, its apparatus or its \\\\ncable, either umpire shall call and signal dead ball. Unless this was already a No ball or Wide, the ball shall \\\\ncount as one of the over. All runs scored to that point shall count, plus the run in progress if the batters have \\\\nalready crossed. \\\\n20.2 Ball finally settled \\\\nWhether the ball is finally settled or not is a matter for the umpire alone to decide. \\\\n20.3 Call of Over or Time \\\\nNeither the call of Over (see clause 17.4), nor the call of Time (see clause 12.2) is to be made until the ball is dead, \\\\neither under clauses 20.1 or 20.4. \\\\n20.4 Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball \\\\n20.4.1 When the ball has become dead under clause 20.1, the bowler’s end umpire may call and signal Dead ball if \\\\nit is necessary to inform the players. \\\\n20.4.2 Where either umpire is required to call and signal Dead ball under 20.4.2.1 to 20.4.2.14, the ball will be \\\\nconsidered to be dead at the instant of the incident causing the ball to become dead. However, where the \\\\nPlaying Conditions specifically provide for the call to be delayed, so as not to disadvantage the non-\\\\noffending side, under clause 34.4 (Runs permitted from the ball lawfully struck more than once), clause \\\\n41.2.1 (Unfair actions) and clause 42.1.2 (Unacceptable conduct), the ball will be considered to be dead at \\\\nthe point of the call. \\\\nEither umpire shall call and signal Dead ball when \\\\n20.4.2.1 intervening in a case of unfair play. \\\\n20.4.2.2 a possibly serious injury to a player or umpire occurs. \\\\n20.4.2.3 leaving his/her normal position for consultation. \\\\n20.4.2.4 one or both bails fall from the striker’s wicket before the striker has had the opportunity of playing \\\\nthe ball. \\\\n20.4.2.5 the striker is not ready for the delivery of the ball and, if the ball is delivered, makes no attempt to \\\\nplay it. Provided the umpire is satisfied that the striker had adequate reason for not being ready, the \\\\nball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n20.4.2.6 the striker is distracted by any noise or movement or in any other way while preparing to receive, or \\\\nreceiving a delivery. This shall apply whether the source of the distraction is within the match or \\\\noutside it. Note also clause 20.4.2.7. The ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n20.4.2.7 there is an instance of a deliberate attempt to distract under either of clauses 41.4 (Deliberate \\\\nattempt to distract striker) or 41.5 (Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter). The \\\\nball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n20.4.2.8 the bowler drops the ball accidentally before delivery. \\\\n20.4.2.9 the bowler throws the ball towards the striker’s end before entering his/her delivery stride \\\\n20.4.2.10 the ball does not leave the bowler’s hand for any reason other than an attempt to run out the non-\\\\nstriker under clause 38.3 (Non-striker leaving his ground early). \\\\n30 \\\\n20.4.2.11 satisfied that the ball in play cannot be recovered. \\\\n20.4.2.12 he/she considers that either side has been disadvantaged by a person, animal or other object within \\\\nthe field of play. However, if both umpires consider the ball would have reached the boundary \\\\nregardless of the intervention, the boundary should stand (see clause 19.2.4 – Identifying and \\\\nmarking the boundary). \\\\n20.4.2.13 the striker attempts to play the ball and no part of his/her person, whether grounded or raised, \\\\nremains within the pitch as defined in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch). \\\\n20.4.2.14 required to do so under any of the Playing Conditions not included above. \\\\n20.5 Ball ceases to be dead \\\\nThe ball ceases to be dead – that is, it comes into play – when the bowler starts his run-up or, if there is no run-up, \\\\nstarts his bowling action. \\\\n20.6 Dead ball not to be revoked \\\\nOnce the ball is dead, no revoking of any decision can bring the ball back into play for that delivery. \\\\n20.7 Dead ball; ball counting as one of over \\\\n20.7.1 When a ball which has been delivered is called dead or is to be considered dead then, other than as in \\\\nclause 20.7.2, \\\\n20.7.1.1 it will not count in the over if the striker has not had an opportunity to play it. \\\\n20.7.1.2 Unless No ball or Wide ball has been called, it will be a valid ball if the striker has had an \\\\nopportunity to play it, except in the circumstances of clauses 20.4.2.6 and 24.4 ( Player returning \\\\nwithout permission), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to distract striker) and 41.5 \\\\n(Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter). \\\\n20.7.2 In clause 20.4.2.5, the ball will not count in the over only if both conditions of not attempting to play the ball \\\\nand having an adequate reason for not being ready are met. Otherwise the delivery will be a valid ball. \\\\n21 NO BALL \\\\n21.1 Mode of delivery \\\\n21.1.1 The umpire shall ascertain whether the bowler intends to bowl right handed or left handed, over or round the \\\\nwicket, and shall so inform the striker. \\\\nIt is unfair if the bowler fails to notify the umpire of a change in his mode of delivery. In this case the umpire \\\\nshall call and signal No ball. \\\\n21.1.2 Underarm bowling shall not be permitted. \\\\n21.2 Fair delivery – the arm \\\\nFor a delivery to be fair in respect of the arm the ball must not be delivered with an Illegal Bowling Action. \\\\nAn Illegal Bowling Action is defined as a bowling action where a bowler’s Elbow Extension exceeds 15 degrees, \\\\nmeasured from the point at which the bowling arm reaches the horizontal until the point at which the ball is released \\\\n(any Elbow Hyperextension shall be discounted for the purposes of determining an Illegal Bowling Action). \\\\nShould either umpire or the ICC Tournament Referee suspect that a bowler has used an Illegal Bowling Action, they \\\\nshall complete the ICC Bowling Action Report Form at the conclusion of the match, as set out in the Illegal Bowling \\\\nRegulations. \\\\n31 \\\\n21.3 Ball thrown or delivered underarm – action by umpires \\\\n21.3.1 If, in the opinion of either umpire, the ball has been thrown (where such mode of delivery does not \\\\ncorrespond to the bowler’s normal bowling action) or delivered underarm, he/she shall call and signal No ball \\\\nand, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- warn the bowler, indicating that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall apply to that bowler \\\\nthroughout the innings. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the batters at the wicket of what has occurred. \\\\n21.3.2 If either umpire considers that, in that innings, a further delivery by the same bowler is thrown (where such \\\\nmode of delivery does not correspond to the bowler’s normal bowling action) or delivered underarm, he/she \\\\nshall call and signal No ball and when the ball is dead inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling. The over shall, if \\\\napplicable, be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled the previous over or part thereof \\\\nnor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. The bowler thus suspended shall not bowl again in that \\\\ninnings. \\\\n- inform the batters at the wicket and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the reason for \\\\nthis action. \\\\n21.3.3 The umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the ICC \\\\nTournament Referee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n21.4 Bowler throwing towards striker’s end before delivery \\\\nIf the bowler throws the ball towards the striker’s end before entering the delivery stride, it is not a No ball and the \\\\nprocedure stated in 21.3 shall not apply. However, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball under Clause 20.4.2.9. \\\\n21.5 Fair delivery – the feet \\\\nFor a delivery to be fair in respect of the feet, in the delivery stride \\\\n21.5.1 the bowler’s back foot must land within and not touching the return crease appertaining to his stated mode of \\\\ndelivery. \\\\n21.5.2 the bowler’s front foot must land with some part of the foot, whether grounded or raised \\\\n- on the same side of the imaginary line joining the two middle stumps as the return crease described in \\\\nclause 21.5.1, and \\\\n- behind the popping crease. \\\\nIf the bowler’s end umpire is satisfied that any of these three conditions have not been met, he/she shall call and \\\\nsignal No ball. See clause 41.8 (Bowling of deliberate front foot No ball). \\\\n21.6 Bowler breaking wicket in delivering ball \\\\nEither umpire shall call and signal No ball if, other than in an attempt to run out the non-striker under clause 38.3 \\\\n(Non-striker leaving his/her ground early), the bowler breaks the wicket at any time after the ball comes into play and \\\\nbefore completion of the stride after the delivery stride. This shall include any clothing or other object that falls from \\\\nhis person and breaks the wicket. \\\\n32 \\\\n21.7 Ball bouncing more than once, rolling along the ground or \\\\npitching off the pitch \\\\nThe umpire shall call and signal No ball if a ball which he/she considers to have been delivered, without having \\\\npreviously touched bat or person of the striker, \\\\n- bounces more than once \\\\n- or rolls along the ground before it reaches the popping crease. \\\\n- or pitches wholly or partially off the pitch as defined in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch) before it reaches the line of the \\\\nstriker’s wicket. \\\\n21.8 Ball causing the striker to leave the pitch or ball coming to \\\\nrest in front of striker’s wicket \\\\nIf a ball delivered by the bowler comes to rest in front of the line of the striker’s wicket, or is so far from the pitch that \\\\nthe striker would need to leave the pitch to attempt to play the ball (see clause 25.6 – Striker’s right to play the ball)  \\\\nwithout having previously touched the bat or person of the striker, the umpire shall call and signal No ball and \\\\nimmediately call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n21.9 Fielder intercepting a delivery \\\\nIf except in the circumstances of clause 27.3 (Position of wicket-keeper) a ball, delivered by the bowler, makes \\\\ncontact with any part of a fielder’s person before it either makes contact with the striker’s bat or person, or it passes \\\\nthe striker’s wicket, the umpire shall call and signal No ball and immediately call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n21.10 Ball bouncing over head height of striker \\\\nSee clauses 22.1.1.2 and 41.6.1.7. \\\\n21.11 Call of No ball for infringement of other clauses \\\\nIn addition to the instances above, No ball is to be called and signalled as required by the following: \\\\nClause 27.3 – Position of wicket-keeper  \\\\nClause 28.4 – Limitation of on side fielders \\\\nClause 28.5 – Fielders not to encroach on pitch \\\\nClause 41.6 – Bowling of dangerous and unfair short pitched deliveries \\\\nClause 41.7 – Bowling of dangerous and unfair non-pitching deliveries \\\\nClause 41.8 – Bowling of deliberate front foot No ball. \\\\n21.12 Revoking a call of No ball \\\\nAn umpire shall revoke the call of No ball if Dead ball is called under any of Laws 20.4.2.4, 20.4.2.5, 20.4.2.6, \\\\n20.4.2.8 or 20.4.2.10 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball). \\\\n21.13 No ball to over-ride Wide \\\\nA call of No ball shall over-ride the call of Wide ball at any time. See clauses 22.1 (Judging a Wide) and 22.2 (Call \\\\nand signal of Wide ball). \\\\n21.14 Ball not dead \\\\nThe ball does not become dead on the call of No ball. \\\\n33 \\\\n21.15 Penalty for a No ball \\\\nA penalty of one run shall be awarded instantly on the call of No ball. Unless the call is revoked, the penalty shall \\\\nstand even if a batter is dismissed. It shall be in addition to any other runs scored, any boundary allowance and any \\\\nother runs awarded for penalties. \\\\n21.16 Runs resulting from a No ball – how scored \\\\nThe one run penalty shall be scored as a No ball extra and shall be debited against the bowler. If other Penalty runs \\\\nhave been awarded to either side these shall be scored as stated in clause 41.17 (Penalty runs). Any runs completed \\\\nby the batters or any boundary allowance shall be credited to the striker if the ball has been struck by the bat; \\\\notherwise they shall also be scored as Byes or Leg byes as appropriate. \\\\n21.17 No ball not to count \\\\nA No ball shall not count as one of the over. See clause 17.3 (Validity of balls). \\\\n21.18 Out from a No ball \\\\nWhen No ball has been called, neither batter shall be out under any of the Playing Conditions except clause 34 (Hit \\\\nthe ball twice), clause 37 (Obstructing the field) or clause 38 (Run out). \\\\n21.19 Free Hit  \\\\n21.19.1 In addition to the above, the delivery following a No ball called (all modes of No ball) shall be a free hit for \\\\nwhichever batter is facing it. If the delivery for the free hit is not a legitimate delivery (any kind of No ball or a \\\\nWide ball) then the next delivery will become a free hit for whichever batter is facing it.  \\\\n21.19.2 For any free hit, the striker can be dismissed only under the circumstances that apply for a No ball, even if \\\\nthe delivery for the free hit is called Wide.  \\\\n21.19.3 Neither field changes nor the exchange of individuals between fielding positions are permitted for free hit \\\\ndeliveries unless: \\\\n21.19.3.1 There is a change of striker (the provisions of clause 41.2 shall apply), or \\\\n21.19.3.2 The No Ball was the result of a fielding restriction breach, in which case the field may be changed to \\\\nthe extent of correcting the breach. \\\\n21.19.4 For clarity, the bowler can change his mode of delivery for the free hit delivery. In such circumstances clause \\\\n21.1 shall apply. \\\\n21.19.5 The umpires will signal a free hit by (after the normal No Ball signal) extending one arm straight upwards \\\\nand moving it in a circular motion. \\\\n22 WIDE BALL \\\\n22.1 Judging a Wide \\\\n22.1.1 If the bowler bowls a ball, not being a No ball, the umpire shall adjudge it a Wide if, according to the \\\\ndefinition in clause 22.1.2 \\\\n22.1.1.1 the ball passes wide of where the striker is standing and which also would have passed wide of the \\\\nstriker standing in a normal batting position. \\\\n22.1.1.2 the ball passes above the head height of the striker standing upright at the popping crease. \\\\n22.1.2 The ball will be considered as passing wide of the striker unless it is sufficiently within reach for him to be \\\\nable to hit it with the bat by means of a normal cricket stroke. \\\\n22.1.3 Umpires are instructed to apply very strict and consistent interpretation in regard to this clause in order to \\\\nprevent negative bowling wide of the wicket. \\\\n34 \\\\n22.2 Call and signal of Wide ball \\\\nIf the umpire adjudges a delivery to be a Wide he/she shall call and signal Wide ball as soon as the ball passes the \\\\nstriker’s wicket. It shall, however, be considered to have been a Wide from the instant that the bowler entered his \\\\ndelivery stride, even though it cannot be called Wide until it passes the striker’s wicket. \\\\n22.3 Revoking a call of Wide ball \\\\n22.3.1 The umpire shall revoke the call of Wide ball if there is any contact between the ball and the striker’s bat or \\\\nperson before the ball comes into contact with any fielder. \\\\n22.3.2 The umpire shall revoke the call of Wide ball if a delivery is called a No ball. See clause 21.13 (No ball to \\\\nover-ride Wide). \\\\n22.4 Delivery not a Wide \\\\n22.4.1 The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide, if the striker, by moving, either causes the ball to \\\\npass wide of him, as defined in clause 22.1.2 or brings the ball sufficiently within reach to be able to hit it by \\\\nmeans of a normal cricket stroke. \\\\n22.4.2 The umpire shall not adjudge a delivery as being a Wide if the ball touches the striker’s bat or person, but \\\\nonly as the ball passes the striker. \\\\n22.5 Ball not dead \\\\nThe ball does not become dead on the call of Wide ball. \\\\n22.6 Penalty for a Wide \\\\nA penalty of one run shall be awarded instantly on the call of Wide ball. Unless the call is revoked, under clause 22.3, \\\\nthis penalty shall stand even if a batter is dismissed, and shall be in addition to any other runs scored, any boundary \\\\nallowance and any other runs awarded for penalties. \\\\n22.7 Runs resulting from a Wide – how scored \\\\nAll runs completed by the batters or a boundary allowance, together with the penalty for the Wide, shall be scored as \\\\nWide balls. Apart from any award of 5 Penalty runs, all runs resulting from a Wide shall be debited against the bowler. \\\\n22.8 Wide not to count \\\\nA Wide shall not count as one of the over. See clause 17.3 (Validity of balls). \\\\n22.9 Out from a Wide \\\\nWhen Wide ball has been called, neither batter shall be out under any of the Playing Conditions except clause 35 (Hit \\\\nwicket), clause 37 (Obstructing the field), clause 38 (Run out) or clause 39 (Stumped). \\\\n23 BYE AND LEG BYE \\\\n23.1 Byes \\\\nIf the ball, delivered by the bowler, not being a Wide, passes the striker without touching his bat or person, any runs \\\\ncompleted by the batters from that delivery, or a boundary allowance, shall be credited as Byes to the batting side. \\\\nAdditionally, if the delivery is a No ball, the one run penalty for such a delivery shall be incurred. \\\\n23.2 Leg byes \\\\n23.2.1 If a ball delivered by the bowler first strikes the person of the striker, runs shall be scored only if the umpire \\\\nis satisfied that the striker has \\\\neither attempted to play the ball with the bat \\\\nor tried to avoid being hit by the ball. \\\\n35 \\\\n23.2.2 If the umpire is satisfied that either of these conditions has been met runs shall be scored as follows. \\\\n23.2.2.1 If there is \\\\neither no subsequent contact with the striker’s bat or person, or \\\\nonly inadvertent contact with the striker’s bat or person \\\\nany runs completed by the batters or a boundary allowance shall be credited to the striker in the \\\\ncase of subsequent contact with his bat but otherwise to the batting side as in clause 23.2.3. \\\\n23.2.2.2 If the striker willfully makes a lawful second strike, clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once) \\\\nand clause 34.4 (Runs permitted from ball lawfully struck more than once) shall apply. \\\\n23.2.3 The runs in clause 23.2.2.1, unless credited to the striker, shall be scored as Leg byes. \\\\nAdditionally, if the delivery is a No ball, the one run penalty for the No ball shall be incurred. \\\\n23.3 Leg byes not to be awarded \\\\nIf in the circumstance of clause 23.2.1 the umpire considers that neither of the conditions therein has been met, then \\\\nLeg byes shall not be awarded. \\\\nIf the ball does not become dead for any other reason, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball as soon as the ball \\\\nreaches the boundary or at the completion of the first run. \\\\nThe umpire shall then: \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side; \\\\n- return any not out batter to his original end; \\\\n- signal No ball to the scorers if applicable; \\\\n- award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging \\\\nto the fielding side). \\\\n24 FIELDER’S ABSENCE; SUBSTITUTES \\\\n24.1 Substitute fielders \\\\n24.1.1 The umpires shall allow a substitute fielder \\\\n24.1.1.1 if they are satisfied that a fielder has been injured or become ill and that this occurred during the \\\\nmatch, or \\\\n24.1.1.2 for any other wholly acceptable reason. \\\\nIn all other circumstances, a substitute is not allowed. \\\\n24.1.2 A substitute shall not bowl or act as captain but may act as wicket-keeper only with the consent of the \\\\numpires. Note, however, clause 42.4.1. \\\\n24.1.3 A nominated player may bowl or field even though a substitute has previously acted for him, subject to 24.2 \\\\nand 24.3. \\\\n24.1.4 Squad members of the fielding or batting team who are not playing in the match and who are not acting as \\\\nsubstitute fielders shall be required to wear a team training bib whilst on the playing area (including the area \\\\nbetween the boundary and the perimeter fencing). \\\\n24.2 Fielder absent or leaving the field of play \\\\n24.2.1 A player going briefly outside the boundary while carrying out any duties as a fielder is not absent from the \\\\nfield of play nor, for the purposes of this clause, is he to be regarded as having left the field of play. \\\\n36 \\\\n24.2.2 If a fielder fails to take the field at the start of play or at any later time, or leaves the field during play, \\\\n24.2.2.1 an umpire shall be informed of the reason for this absence. \\\\n24.2.2.2 he shall not thereafter come on to the field of play during a session of play without the consent of \\\\nthe umpire. See clause 24.4. The umpire shall give such consent as soon as it is practicable. \\\\n24.2.3 If a player is absent from the field for longer than 8 minutes, the following restrictions shall apply to their \\\\nfuture participation in the match: \\\\n24.2.3.1 The player shall not be permitted to bowl in the match until he has either been able to field, or his \\\\nteam has subsequently been batting, for the total length of playing time for which the player was \\\\nabsent (hereafter referred to as Penalty time). A player’s unexpired Penalty time shall be limited to a \\\\nmaximum of 120 minutes. If any unexpired Penalty time remains at the end of an innings, it is \\\\ncarried forward to the next and subsequent innings of the match. \\\\n24.2.3.2 The player shall not be permitted to bat in the match until his team’s batting innings has been in \\\\nprogress for the length of playing time that is equal to the unexpired Penalty time carried forward \\\\nfrom the previous innings. However, once his side has lost five wickets in its batting innings, he may \\\\nbat immediately. If any unexpired penalty time remains at the end of that batting innings, it is carried \\\\nforward to the next and subsequent innings of the match. \\\\n24.2.4 If the player leaves the field before having served all of his Penalty time, the balance is carried forward as \\\\nunserved Penalty time. \\\\n24.2.5 On any occasion of absence, the amount of playing time for which the player is off the field shall be added to \\\\nany Penalty time that remains unserved, subject to a maximum cumulative Penalty time of 120 minutes, and \\\\nthat player shall not bowl until all of his Penalty time has been served. \\\\n24.2.6 For the purposes of clauses 24.2.3.1 and 24.2.3.2, playing time shall comprise the time play is in progress \\\\nexcluding intervals, intervals between innings and official drinks intervals. For clarity, a player’s Penalty time \\\\nwill continue to expire after he is dismissed, for the remainder of his team’s batting innings. \\\\n24.2.7 If there is an unscheduled break in play, the stoppage time shall count as Penalty time served, provided that, \\\\n24.2.7.1 the fielder who was on the field of play at the start of the break either takes the field on the \\\\nresumption of play, or his side is now batting. \\\\n24.2.7.2 the fielder who was already off the field at the start of the break notifies an umpire in person as soon \\\\nas he is able to participate, and either takes the field on the resumption of play, or his side is now \\\\nbatting. Stoppage time before an umpire has been so notified shall not count towards unserved \\\\nPenalty time. \\\\n24.2.8 Any unserved Penalty time shall be carried forward into the next innings of the match, as applicable. \\\\n24.3 Penalty time not incurred \\\\nA nominated player’s absence will not incur Penalty time if, \\\\n24.3.1 he has suffered an external blow during the match and, as a result, has justifiably left the field or is unable to \\\\ntake the field. \\\\n24.3.2 in the opinion of the umpires, the player has been absent or has left the field for other wholly acceptable \\\\nreasons, which shall not include illness or internal injury. \\\\n24.3.3 the player is absent from the field for a period of 8 minutes or less. \\\\n24.4 Player returning without permission \\\\nIf a player comes on to the field of play in contravention of clause 24.2.2 and comes into contact with the ball while it \\\\nis in play, the ball shall immediately become dead. \\\\n- The umpires shall signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers, if applicable. \\\\n- The umpire shall award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\n37 \\\\n- Runs completed by the batters shall be scored together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the \\\\ninstant of the offence. \\\\n- The ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n- The umpire shall inform the other umpire, the captain of the fielding side, the batters and, as soon as practicable, \\\\nthe captain of the batting side of the reason for this action. \\\\n25 BATTER’S INNINGS \\\\n25.1 Eligibility to act as a batter \\\\nOnly a nominated player may bat and, subject to clause 25.3, may do so even though a substitute fielder has \\\\npreviously acted for him. \\\\n25.2 Commencement of a batter’s innings \\\\nThe innings of the first two batters, and that of any new batter on the resumption of play after a call of Time, shall \\\\ncommence at the call of Play. At any other time, a batter’s innings shall be considered to have commenced when that \\\\nbatter first steps onto the field of play. \\\\n25.3 Restriction on batter commencing an innings \\\\n25.3.1 If a member of the batting side has unserved Penalty time, see clause 24.2.7, that player shall not be \\\\npermitted to bat until that Penalty time has been served. However, even if the unserved Penalty time has not \\\\nexpired, that player may bat after his side has lost 5 wickets. \\\\n25.3.2 A member of the batting side’s Penalty time is served during Playing time, in the event of an unscheduled \\\\nstoppage, the stoppage time after the batter notifies an umpire in person that he is able to participate shall \\\\ncount as Penalty time served. \\\\n25.3.3 If any unserved Penalty time remains at the end of a team’s innings, it shall be carried forward to the next \\\\ninnings of the match if appropriate. \\\\n25.4 Batter retiring \\\\n25.4.1 A batter may retire at any time during his innings when the ball is dead. The umpires, before allowing play to \\\\nproceed, shall be informed of the reason for a batter retiring. \\\\n25.4.2 If a batter retires because of illness, injury or any other unavoidable cause, that batter is entitled to resume \\\\nhis innings. If for any reason this does not happen, that batter is to be recorded as ‘Retired - not out’. \\\\n25.4.3 If a batter retires for any reason other than as in clause 25.4.2, the innings of that batter may be resumed \\\\nonly with the consent of the opposing captain. If for any reason his innings is not resumed, that batter is to \\\\nbe recorded as ‘Retired - out’. \\\\n25.4.4 If after retiring a batter resumes his innings, subject to the requirements of clauses 25.4.2 and 25.4.3, it shall \\\\nbe only at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of another batter. \\\\n25.5 Runners \\\\nRunners shall not be permitted. \\\\n25.6 Striker’s right to play the ball \\\\nThe striker has a right to play the ball, or to make a legitimate second strike, after it has been delivered, without \\\\ninterference from the wicket-keeper or any other fielder (see clause 27.5 – Restrictions on actions of wicket-keeper \\\\nand clause 27.6 – Interference with wicket-keeper by striker). \\\\nHowever, the striker may only attempt to play the ball if some of his/her bat or person, whether grounded or raised, \\\\nremains within the pitch, as defined in clause 6.1 (Area of pitch). Should no part of the striker’s bat or person remain \\\\nwithin the pitch, whilst the striker is playing the ball, either umpire shall immediately call and signal Dead ball.  \\\\n38 \\\\n26 PRACTICE ON THE FIELD \\\\n26.1 Practice on the pitch or the rest of the square \\\\n26.1.1 There shall not be any practice on the pitch at any time. \\\\n26.1.2 There shall not be any practice on the rest of the square at any time except with the approval of the umpires. \\\\n26.1.2.1 If approved by the umpires, the use of the square for practice on any day of any match will be \\\\nrestricted to any netted practice area or bowling strips specifically prepared on the edge of the \\\\nsquare for that purpose. \\\\n26.1.2.2 Bowling practice on the bowling strips referred to above shall also be permitted during the interval \\\\n(and change of innings if not the interval) unless the umpires consider that, in the prevailing \\\\nconditions of ground and weather, it will be detrimental to the surface of the square. \\\\n26.2 Practice on the outfield \\\\n26.2.1 On any day of the match, all forms of practice are permitted on the outfield \\\\n- before the start of play \\\\n- after the close of play, and \\\\n - during the interval or between innings \\\\nproviding the umpires are satisfied that such practice will not cause significant deterioration in the condition \\\\nof the outfield. \\\\n26.2.2 Between the call of Play and the call of Time, practice shall be permitted on the outfield, providing that all of \\\\nthe following conditions are met: \\\\n- only the fielders as defined in paragraph 7 of Appendix A participate in such practice. \\\\n- no ball other than the match ball is used for this practice. \\\\n- no bowling practice takes place in the area between the square and the boundary in a direction parallel to \\\\nthe match pitch. \\\\n- the umpires are satisfied that it will not contravene either of clauses 41.3 (The match ball changing its \\\\ncondition) or 41.9 (Time wasting by the fielding side). \\\\nBowling a ball, using a short run up to a player in the outfield is not to be regarded as bowling practice but \\\\nshall be subject to the other conditions in this clause. \\\\n26.3 Trial run-up \\\\nA bowler is permitted to have a trial run-up provided the umpire is satisfied that it will not contravene either of clauses \\\\n41.9 (Time wasting by the fielding side) or 41.12 (Fielder damaging the pitch). \\\\n26.4 Penalties for contravention \\\\nAll forms of practice are subject to the provisions of clauses 41.3 (The match ball – changing its condition), 41.9 \\\\n(Time wasting by the fielding side) and 41.12 (Fielder damaging the pitch). \\\\n26.4.1 If there is a contravention of any of the provisions of clause 26.1 or 26.2, the umpire shall \\\\n- warn the player that the practice is not permitted; \\\\n- inform the other umpire and, as soon as practicable, both captains of the reason for this action. \\\\n26.4.1.1 If the contravention is by a batter at the wicket, the umpire shall inform the other batter and each \\\\nincoming batter that the warning has been issued. The warning shall apply to the team of that player \\\\nthroughout the match. \\\\n39 \\\\n26.4.2 If during the match there is any further contravention by any player of that team, the umpire shall \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side; \\\\n- inform the other umpire, the scorers and, as soon as practicable, both captains, and, if the contravention is \\\\nduring play, the batters at the wicket. \\\\n27 THE WICKET-KEEPER \\\\n27.1 Protective equipment \\\\nThe wicket-keeper is the only fielder permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards. If these are worn, they are to \\\\nbe regarded as part of his person for the purposes of clause 28.2 (Fielding the ball). If by the wicket-keeper’s actions \\\\nand positioning when the ball comes into play it is apparent to the umpires that he will not be able to carry out the \\\\nnormal duties of a wicket-keeper, he shall forfeit this right and also the right to be recognised as a wicket-keeper for \\\\nthe purposes of clauses 33.2 (A fair catch), 39 (Stumped), 28.1 (Protective equipment), 28.4 (Limitation of on-side \\\\nfielders) and 28.5 (Fielders not to encroach on pitch). \\\\n27.2 Gloves \\\\n27.2.1 If, as permitted under clause 27.1, the wicket-keeper wears gloves, they shall have no webbing between the \\\\nfingers except joining index finger and thumb, where webbing may be inserted as a means of support. \\\\n27.2.2 If used, the webbing shall be a single piece of non-stretch material which, although it may have facing \\\\nmaterial attached, shall have no reinforcements or tucks. \\\\n27.2.3 The top edge of the webbing shall not protrude beyond the straight line joining the top of the index finger to \\\\nthe top of the thumb and shall be taut when a hand wearing the glove has the thumb fully extended. See \\\\nparagraph 3 of Appendix B. \\\\n27.3 Position of wicket-keeper \\\\n27.3.1 The wicket-keeper shall remain wholly behind the wicket at the striker’s end from the moment the ball comes \\\\ninto play until a ball delivered by the bowler \\\\ntouches the bat or person of the striker, or \\\\npasses the wicket at the striker’s end, or \\\\nthe striker attempts a run. \\\\n27.3.2 In the event of the wicket-keeper contravening this clause, the striker’s end umpire shall call and signal No \\\\nball as soon as applicable after the delivery of the ball. \\\\n27.4 Movement by wicket-keeper \\\\n27.4.1 After the ball comes into play and before it reaches the striker, it is unfair if the wicket-keeper significantly \\\\nalters his position in relation to the striker’s wicket, except for the following: \\\\n27.4.1.1 movement of a few paces forward for a slower delivery, unless in so doing it brings him within reach \\\\nof the wicket. \\\\n27.4.1.2 lateral movement in response to the direction in which the ball has been delivered. \\\\n27.4.1.3 movement in response to the stroke that the striker is playing or that his actions suggest he intends \\\\nto play. However the provisions of clause 27.3 shall apply. \\\\n27.4.2 In the event of unfair movement by the wicket-keeper, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball and \\\\ninform the other umpire of the reason for doing so. The bowler’s end umpire shall then: \\\\n27.4.2.1 award the one-run penalty for Wide or No ball, if applicable  \\\\n27.4.2.2 award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side \\\\n40 \\\\n27.4.2.3 inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\n27.4.2.4 inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the ICC Tournament \\\\nReferee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the wicket-keeper concerned. \\\\n27.5 Restriction on actions of wicket-keeper \\\\nIf, in the opinion of either umpire, the wicket-keeper interferes with the striker’s right to play the ball and to guard his \\\\nwicket, clause 20.4.2.6 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball) shall apply. \\\\nIf, however, either umpire considers that the interference by the wicket-keeper was willful, then clause 41.4 \\\\n(Deliberate attempt to distract striker) shall also apply. \\\\n27.6 Interference with wicket-keeper by striker \\\\nIf, in playing at the ball or in the legitimate defence of his wicket, the striker interferes with the wicket-keeper, he shall \\\\nnot be out except as provided for in clause 37.3 (Obstructing a ball from being caught). \\\\n28 THE FIELDER \\\\n28.1 Protective equipment \\\\nNo fielder other than the wicket-keeper shall be permitted to wear gloves or external leg guards. In addition, \\\\nprotection for the hand or fingers may be worn only with the consent of the umpires. \\\\n28.2 Fielding the ball \\\\n28.2.1 A fielder may field the ball with any part of his person (see paragraph 12 of Appendix A), except as in clause \\\\n28.2.1.2. However, he will be deemed to have fielded the ball illegally if, while the ball is in play he willfully \\\\n28.2.1.1 uses anything other than part of his person to field the ball. \\\\n28.2.1.2 extends his clothing with his hands and uses this to field the ball. \\\\n28.2.1.3 discards a piece of clothing, equipment or any other object which subsequently makes contact with \\\\nthe ball. \\\\n28.2.2 It is not illegal fielding if the ball in play makes contact with a piece of clothing, equipment or any other object \\\\nwhich has accidentally fallen from the fielder’s person, or been dropped by an umpire. \\\\n28.2.3 If a fielder illegally fields the ball, the ball shall immediately become dead and \\\\n- the penalty for a No ball or a Wide shall stand. \\\\n- any runs completed by the batters shall be credited to the batting side, together with the run in progress if \\\\nthe batters had already crossed at the instant of the offence. \\\\n- the ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\nIn addition the umpire shall: \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\n- inform the other umpire and the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. \\\\n28.3 Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side \\\\n28.3.1 Protective helmets, when not in use by fielders, may not be placed on the ground, above the surface except \\\\nbehind the wicket-keeper and in line with both sets of stumps. \\\\n41 \\\\n28.3.2 If the ball while in play strikes the protective helmet, placed as described in clause 28.3.1 the ball shall \\\\nimmediately become Dead and, unless 28.3.3. applies: \\\\nthe umpire shall signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers, if applicable \\\\nthe umpire shall award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side; \\\\n28.3.2.1 any runs completed by the batters before the ball strikes the protective helmet shall be scored, \\\\ntogether with the run in progress if the batters had already crossed at the instant of the ball striking \\\\nthe protective helmet. \\\\n28.3.3 If the ball while in play strikes  the protective helmet, placed as described in clause 28.3.1, and the \\\\ncircumstances of clause 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded) or clause 34 (Hit the ball twice) apply, the \\\\numpire shall: \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\\\n- return any not out batter to his original end \\\\n- signal No ball or Wide ball to the scorers if applicable \\\\n- award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3.2. \\\\n28.4 Limitation of on side fielders \\\\n28.4.1 At the instant of delivery, there may not be more than 5 fielders on the leg side. \\\\n28.4.2 At the instant of the bowler’s delivery there shall not be more than two fielders, other than the wicket-keeper, \\\\nbehind the popping crease on the on side. A fielder will be considered to be behind the popping crease \\\\nunless the whole of his person whether grounded or in the air is in front of this line. \\\\n28.4.3 In the event of infringement of this clause by any fielder, the striker’s end umpire shall call and signal No \\\\nball. \\\\n28.5 Fielders not to encroach on pitch \\\\nWhile the ball is in play and until the ball has made contact with the striker’s bat or person, or has passed the striker’s \\\\nbat, no fielder, other than the bowler, may have any part of his person grounded on or extended over the pitch. \\\\nIn the event of infringement of this clause by any fielder other than the wicket-keeper, the bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\ncall and signal No ball as soon as possible after delivery of the ball. Note, however, clause 27.3 (Position of wicket-\\\\nkeeper). \\\\n28.6 Movement by any fielder other than the wicket-keeper \\\\n28.6.1 Any movement by any fielder, excluding the wicket-keeper, after the ball comes into play and before the ball \\\\nreaches the striker, is unfair except for the following: \\\\n28.6.1.1 minor adjustments to stance or position in relation to the striker’s wicket. \\\\n28.6.1.2 movement by any fielder, other than a close fielder, towards the striker or the striker’s wicket that \\\\ndoes not significantly alter the position of the fielder. \\\\n28.6.1.3 movement by any fielder in response to the stroke that the striker is playing or that his actions \\\\nsuggest he intends to play. \\\\n28.6.2 In all circumstances clause 28.4 (Limitation of on side fielders) shall apply. \\\\n28.6.3 In the event of such unfair movement, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball and inform the other \\\\numpire of the reason for doing so. The bowler’s end umpire shall then: \\\\n28.6.3.1 award the one-run penalty for Wide or No ball, if applicable  \\\\n28.6.3.2 award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side \\\\n28.6.3.3 inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\n42 \\\\n28.6.3.4 inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has \\\\noccurred. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence as soon as possible after the match to the ICC \\\\nTournament Referee, who shall take such action as is considered appropriate against the fielder \\\\nconcerned. \\\\n28.6.4 Note also the provisions of clause 41.4 (Deliberate attempt to distract striker). See also clause 27.4 \\\\n(Movement by wicket-keeper). \\\\n28.7 Restrictions on the placement of fielders  \\\\n28.7.1 In addition to the restrictions contained in clause 28.4 above, further fielding restrictions shall apply to certain \\\\novers in each innings. The nature of such fielding restrictions and the overs during which they shall apply are \\\\nset out in the following paragraphs.  \\\\n28.7.2 The following fielding restrictions shall apply:  \\\\n28.7.2.1 Two semi-circles shall be drawn on the field of play. The semi-circles shall have as their centre the \\\\nmiddle stump at either end of the pitch. The radius of each of the semi-circles shall be 30 yards \\\\n(27.43 metres). The semi-circles shall be linked by two parallel straight lines drawn on the field. \\\\n(Refer to paragraph 2 of Appendix C). The fielding restriction areas should be marked by \\\\ncontinuous painted white lines or ‘dots’ at 5 yard (4.57 metres) intervals, each ‘dot’ to be covered by \\\\na white plastic or rubber (but not metal) disc measuring 7 inches (18 cm) in diameter.  \\\\n28.7.2.2 At the instant of delivery:  \\\\n28.7.2.2.1 Powerplay 1 - no more than two (2) fielders shall be permitted outside this fielding \\\\nrestriction area. In an innings of 50 overs, these are overs 1 to 10 inclusive.  \\\\n28.7.2.2.2 Powerplay 2 - no more than four (4) fielders shall be permitted outside this fielding \\\\nrestriction area. In an innings of 50 overs, these are overs 11 to 40 inclusive  \\\\n28.7.2.2.3 Powerplay 3 - no more than five (5) fielders shall be permitted outside this fielding \\\\nrestriction area. In an innings of 50 overs, these are overs 41 to 50 inclusive  \\\\n28.7.2.3 In circumstances when the number of overs of the batting team is reduced, the number of overs \\\\nwithin each phase of the innings shall be reduced in accordance with the table below. For the sake \\\\nof clarity, it should be noted that the table shall apply to both the 1st and 2nd innings of the match. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nInnings duration Powerplay 1 Powerplay 2 Powerplay 3 \\\\n20 4 12 4 \\\\n21 4 13 4 \\\\n22 5 13 4 \\\\n23 5 14 4 \\\\n24 5 14 5 \\\\n25 5 15 5 \\\\n26 5 16 5 \\\\n27 6 16 5 \\\\n28 6 17 5 \\\\n29 6 17 6 \\\\n30 6 18 6 \\\\n31 6 19 6 \\\\n32 7 19 6 \\\\n33 7 20 6 \\\\n34 7 20 7 \\\\n35 7 21 7 \\\\n36 7 22 7 \\\\n37 8 22 7 \\\\n38 8 23 7 \\\\n39 8 23 8 \\\\n43 \\\\n40 8 24 8 \\\\n41 8 25 8 \\\\n42 9 25 8 \\\\n43 9 26 8 \\\\n44 9 26 9 \\\\n45 9 27 9 \\\\n46 9 28 9 \\\\n47 10 28 9 \\\\n48 10 29 9 \\\\n49 10 29 10 \\\\n \\\\n28.7.2.4 If play is interrupted during an innings and the table above applies, the Powerplay takes immediate \\\\neffect. For the avoidance of doubt this applies even if the interruption has occurred mid-over. \\\\nIllustrations: \\\\nA 50 over innings is interrupted after 8.3 overs and reduced to 32 overs. The new phases \\\\nare 7+19+6. Therefore the middle phase fielding restrictions take immediate effect when \\\\nplay resumes and last for a further 17.3 overs. The final phase begins after 26 overs have \\\\nbeen bowled. \\\\nA 40 over innings is interrupted after 18.5 overs and reduced to 22 overs. The new phases \\\\nare 5+13+4. When play resumes, the final phase fielding restrictions apply for the \\\\nremaining 3.1 overs. \\\\n28.7.2.5 At the commencement of the middle and final phases of an innings, the umpire shall signal such \\\\ncommencement to the scorers by rotating his arm in a large circle.  \\\\n28.7.2.6 The scoreboard shall indicate the current Powerplay in progress.  \\\\n28.7.2.7 In the event of an infringement of any of the above fielding restrictions, the square leg umpire shall \\\\ncall and signal No ball. \\\\n29 THE WICKET IS BROKEN \\\\n \\\\n29.1 Wicket put down \\\\nThe wicket is broken when at least one bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps, or one or more stumps \\\\nis removed from the ground. \\\\n29.2    Breaking the wicket fairly \\\\n29.2.1 The wicket is broken fairly if a bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps or a stump is struck out of \\\\nthe ground. \\\\n29.2.1.1 by the ball, \\\\n29.2.1.2 by the striker’s bat if held or by any part of the bat that he is holding, \\\\n29.2.1.3 for the purpose of this clause only, by the striker\\'s bat not in hand, or by any part of the bat \\\\nwhich has become detached, \\\\n29.2.1.4 by the striker’s person or by any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached from \\\\nhis person, \\\\n29.2.1.5 by a fielder with his hand or arm, providing that the ball is held in the hand or hands so \\\\nused, or in the hand of the arm so used. \\\\n29.2.1.6 The wicket is also broken fairly if a fielder strikes or pulls a stump out of the ground as in \\\\nclause 29.1.2.5. \\\\n44 \\\\n29.2 2 The disturbance of a bail, whether temporary or not, shall not constitute its complete removal from the top of \\\\nthe stumps, but if a bail in falling lodges between two of the stumps this shall be regarded as complete removal. \\\\n29.3 One bail off \\\\nIf one bail is off, it shall be sufficient for the purpose of breaking the wicket to remove the remaining bail or to strike or \\\\npull any of the three stumps out of the ground, in any of the ways stated in clause 29.1. \\\\n29.4 Remaking wicket \\\\nIf a wicket is broken or put down while the ball is in play, it shall not be remade by an umpire until the ball is dead. \\\\nSee clause 20 (Dead ball). Any fielder may, however, while the ball is in play, \\\\n- replace a bail or bails on top of the stumps. \\\\n- put back one or more stumps into the ground where the wicket originally stood. \\\\n29.5 Dispensing with bails \\\\nIf the umpires have agreed to dispense with bails in accordance with clause 8.4 (Dispensing with bails), it is for the \\\\numpire concerned to decide whether or not the wicket has been broken. \\\\n29.5.1 After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been broken fairly if the umpire concerned is satisfied that \\\\nthe wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker’s bat, person or items of his clothing or equipment as described \\\\nin clauses 29.2.1.2, 29.2.1.3 or 29.2.1.4, or by a fielder in the manner described in clause 29.2.1.5. \\\\n29.5.2 If the wicket has already been broken or put down, clause 29.5.1 shall apply to any stump or stumps still in the \\\\nground. Any fielder may replace a stump or stumps, in accordance with clause 29.4, in order to have an opportunity \\\\nof breaking the wicket fairly. \\\\n30 BATTER OUT OF HIS GROUND \\\\n30.1 When out of his ground \\\\n30.1.1 A batter shall be considered to be out of his ground unless some part of his person or bat is grounded \\\\nbehind the popping crease at that end. \\\\n30.1.2 However, a batter shall not be considered to be out of his ground if, in running or diving towards his ground \\\\nand beyond, and having grounded some part of his person or bat beyond the popping crease, there is \\\\nsubsequent loss of contact between the ground and any part of his person or bat, or between the bat and \\\\nperson. \\\\n30.2 Which is a batter’s ground \\\\n30.2.1 If only one batter is within a ground, it is his ground and will remain so even if he is later joined there by the \\\\nother batter. \\\\n30.2.2 If both batters are in the same ground and one of them subsequently leaves it, the ground belongs to the \\\\nbatter who remains in it. \\\\n30.2.3 If there is no batter in either ground, then each ground belongs to whichever batter is nearer to it, or, if the \\\\nbatters are level, to whichever batter was nearer to it immediately prior to their drawing level. \\\\n30.2.4 If a ground belongs to one batter then the other ground belongs to the other batter, irrespective of his \\\\nposition. \\\\n30.3 Position of non-striker \\\\nThe non-striker, when standing at the bowler’s end, should be positioned on the opposite side of the wicket to that \\\\nfrom which the ball is being delivered, unless a request to do otherwise is granted by the umpire. \\\\n45 \\\\n31 APPEALS \\\\n31.1 Umpire not to give batter out without an appeal \\\\nNeither umpire shall give a batter out, even though he may be out under these Playing Conditions, unless appealed \\\\nto by a fielder. This shall not debar a batter who is out under these Playing Conditions from leaving the wicket without \\\\nan appeal having been made. Note, however, the provisions of clause 31.7. \\\\n31.2 Batter dismissed \\\\nA batter is dismissed if he is: \\\\n- either given out by an umpire, on appeal \\\\n- or out under these Playing Conditions and leaves the wicket as in clause 31.1. \\\\n31.3 Timing of appeals \\\\nFor an appeal to be valid, it must be made before the bowler begins his run-up or, if there is no run-up, his bowling \\\\naction to deliver the next ball, and before Time has been called. \\\\nThe call of Over does not invalidate an appeal made prior to the start of the following over, provided Time has not \\\\nbeen called. See clauses 12.2 (Call of Time) and 17.2 (Start of an over). \\\\n31.4 Appeal “How’s That?” \\\\nAn appeal “How’s That?” covers all ways of being out. \\\\n31.5 Answering appeals \\\\nThe striker’s end umpire shall answer all appeals arising out of any of clauses 35 (Hit wicket), 39 (Stumped) or 38 \\\\n(Run out) when this occurs at the wicket-keeper’s end. The bowler’s end umpire shall answer all other appeals. \\\\nWhen an appeal is made, each umpire shall answer on any matter that falls within his jurisdiction. \\\\nWhen a batter has been given Not out, either umpire may answer an appeal, made in accordance with clause 31.3, if \\\\nit is on a further matter and is within his jurisdiction. \\\\n31.6 Consultation by umpires \\\\nEach umpire shall answer appeals on matters within his/her own jurisdiction. If an umpire is doubtful about any point \\\\nthat the other umpire may have been in a better position to see, he/she shall consult the latter on this point of fact and \\\\nshall then give the decision. If, after consultation, there is still doubt remaining, the decision shall be Not out. \\\\n31.7 Batter leaving the wicket under a misapprehension \\\\nAn umpire shall intervene if satisfied that a batter, not having been given out, has left the wicket under a \\\\nmisapprehension of being out. The umpire intervening shall call and signal Dead ball to prevent any further action by \\\\nthe fielding side and shall recall the batter. \\\\nA batter may be recalled at any time up to the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery, unless it is \\\\nthe final wicket of the innings, in which case it should be up to the instant when the umpires leave the field. \\\\n31.8 Withdrawal of an appeal \\\\nThe captain of the fielding side may withdraw an appeal only after obtaining the consent of the umpire within whose \\\\njurisdiction the appeal falls. If such consent is given, the umpire concerned shall, if applicable, revoke the decision \\\\nand recall the batter. \\\\nThe withdrawal of an appeal must be before the instant when the ball comes into play for the next delivery or, if the \\\\ninnings has been completed, the instant when the umpires leave the field. \\\\n46 \\\\n32 BOWLED \\\\n32.1 Out Bowled \\\\n32.1.1 The striker is out Bowled if his wicket is broken by a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a No ball, even if \\\\nit first touches the striker’s bat or person. \\\\n32.1.2 However, the striker shall not be out Bowled if before striking the wicket the ball has been in contact with any \\\\nother player or an umpire. The striker will, however, be subject to clauses 37 (Obstructing the field), 38 (Run \\\\nout) and 39 (Stumped). \\\\n32.2 Bowled to take precedence \\\\nThe striker is out Bowled if his wicket is broken as in clause 32.1, even though a decision against him for any other \\\\nmethod of dismissal would be justified. \\\\n33 CAUGHT \\\\n33.1 Out Caught \\\\nThe striker is out Caught if a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a No ball, touches his bat without having \\\\npreviously been in contact with any fielder, and is subsequently held by a fielder as a fair catch, as described in \\\\nclauses 33.2 and 33.3, before it touches the ground. \\\\n33.2 A fair catch \\\\n33.2.1 A catch will be fair only if, in every case: \\\\n- either the ball, at any time \\\\n- or any fielder in contact with the ball, \\\\n- is not grounded beyond the boundary before the catch is completed. Note clauses 19.4 (Ball \\\\ngrounded beyond the boundary) and 19.5 (Fielder grounded beyond the boundary). \\\\n33.2.2 Furthermore, a catch will be fair if any of the following conditions applies: \\\\n33.2.2.1 the ball is held in the hand or hands of a fielder, even if the hand holding the ball is touching the \\\\nground, or is hugged to the body, or lodges in the external protective equipment worn by a fielder, \\\\nor lodges accidentally in a fielder’s clothing. \\\\n33.2.2.2 a fielder catches the ball after it has been lawfully struck more than once by the striker, but only if it \\\\nhas not been grounded since it was first struck. See clause 34 (Hit the ball twice). \\\\n33.2.2.3 a fielder catches the ball after it has touched the wicket, an umpire, another fielder or the other \\\\nbatter. \\\\n33.2.2.4 a fielder catches the ball after it has crossed the boundary in the air, provided that the conditions in \\\\nclause 33.2.1 are met. \\\\n33.2.2.5 the ball is caught off an obstruction within the boundary that is not designated a boundary by the \\\\numpires. \\\\n33.3 Making a catch \\\\nThe act of making a catch shall start from the time when the ball first comes into contact with a fielder’s person and \\\\nshall end when a fielder obtains complete control over both the ball and his own movement. \\\\n33.4 No runs to be scored \\\\nIf the striker is dismissed Caught, runs from that delivery completed by the batters before the completion of the catch \\\\nshall not be scored but any runs for penalties awarded to either side shall stand. The non-striker shall return to his \\\\noriginal end. See clause 18.11 Batter returning to original end. \\\\n47 \\\\n33.5 Caught to take precedence \\\\nIf the criteria of clause 33.1 are met and the striker is not out Bowled, then he is out Caught, even though a decision \\\\nagainst either batter for another method of dismissal would be justified. \\\\n34 HIT THE BALL TWICE \\\\n34.1 Out Hit the ball twice \\\\n34.1.1 The striker is out Hit the ball twice if, while the ball is in play, it strikes any part of his person or is struck by \\\\nhis bat and, before the ball has been touched by a fielder, the striker willfully strikes it again with his bat or \\\\nperson, other than a hand not holding the bat, except for the sole purpose of guarding his wicket. See clause \\\\n34.3 and clause 37 (Obstructing the field). \\\\n34.1.2 For the purpose of this clause ‘struck’ or ‘strike’ shall include contact with the person of the striker. \\\\n34.1.3  This clause will apply whether or not No ball is called. \\\\n34.2 Not out Hit the ball twice \\\\nThe striker will not be out under this clause if he \\\\n34.2.1 strikes the ball a second or subsequent time in order to return the ball to any fielder.  \\\\nNote, however, the provisions of clause 37.4 (Returning the ball to a fielder). \\\\n34.2.2 willfully strikes the ball after it has touched a fielder. Note, however the provisions of clause 37.1 (Out \\\\nObstructing the field). \\\\n34.3 Ball lawfully struck more than once \\\\nThe striker may, solely in order to guard his wicket and before the ball has been touched by a fielder, lawfully strike \\\\nthe ball a second or subsequent time with the bat, or with any part of his person other than a hand not holding the \\\\nbat. The striker may guard his wicket even if the delivery is a No ball. \\\\nHowever, the striker may not prevent the ball from being caught by striking the ball more than once in defence of his \\\\nwicket. See clause 37.3 (Obstructing a ball from being caught). \\\\n34.4 Runs permitted from ball lawfully struck more than once \\\\nWhen the ball is lawfully struck more than once, as permitted in clause 34.3, if the ball does not become dead for any \\\\nreason, the umpire shall call and signal Dead ball as soon as the ball reaches the boundary or at the completion of \\\\nthe first run. However, the umpire shall delay the call of Dead ball to allow the opportunity for a catch to be \\\\ncompleted. \\\\nThe umpire shall \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\\\n- return any not out batter to his original end \\\\n- signal No ball to the scorers if applicable, and \\\\n- award any 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging \\\\nto the fielding side). \\\\n34.5 Bowler does not get credit \\\\nThe bowler does not get credit for the wicket. \\\\n48 \\\\n35 HIT WICKET \\\\n35.1 Out Hit wicket \\\\n35.1.1 The striker is out Hit wicket if, after the bowler has entered the delivery stride and while the ball is in play, his \\\\nwicket is  broken by either the striker’s bat or person as described in clauses 29.2.1.2 to 29.2.1.4 ( Breaking \\\\nthe wicket fairly) in any of the following circumstances: \\\\n35.1.1.1 in the course of any action taken by him in preparing to receive or in receiving a delivery, \\\\n35.1.1.2 in setting off for the first run immediately after playing or playing at the ball, \\\\n35.1.1.3 if no attempt is made to play the ball, in setting off for the first run, providing that in the opinion of \\\\nthe umpire this is immediately after the striker has had the opportunity of playing the ball, \\\\n35.1.1.4 in lawfully making a second or further stroke for the purpose of guarding his wicket within the \\\\nprovisions of clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once). \\\\n35.1.2 If the striker breaks his wicket  in any of the ways described in clauses 29.2.1.2 to 29.2.1.4 (Breaking the \\\\nwicket fairly) before the bowler has entered the delivery stride, either umpire shall call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n35.2 Not out Hit wicket \\\\nThe striker is not out under this clause should his wicket be put down in any of the ways referred to in clause 35.1 if \\\\nany of the following applies: \\\\n- it occurs after the striker has completed any action in receiving the delivery, other than in clauses 35.1.1.2 to \\\\n35.1.1.4. \\\\n- it occurs when the striker is in the act of running, other than setting off immediately for the first run. \\\\n- it occurs when the striker is trying to avoid being run out or stumped. \\\\n- it occurs when the striker is trying to avoid a throw in at any time. \\\\n- the bowler after entering the delivery stride does not deliver the ball. In this case either umpire shall immediately call \\\\nand signal Dead ball. See clause 20.4 (Umpire calling and signalling Dead ball). \\\\n- the delivery is a No ball. \\\\n35.3 Runs scored \\\\nNo runs shall be scored when the striker is dismissed Hit wicket other than the one-run penalty for a Wide and any \\\\naward of 5 Penalty Runs. \\\\n36 LEG BEFORE WICKET \\\\n36.1 Out LBW \\\\nThe striker is out LBW if all the circumstances set out in clauses 36.1.1 to 36.1.5 apply. \\\\n36.1.1 The bowler delivers a ball, not being a No ball \\\\n36.1.2 the ball, if it is not intercepted full-pitch, pitches in line between wicket and wicket or on the off side of the \\\\nstriker’s wicket \\\\n36.1.3 the ball not having previously touched his bat, the striker intercepts the ball, either full-pitch or after pitching, \\\\nwith any part of his person \\\\n36.1.4 the point of impact, even if above the level of the bails: \\\\n- either is between wicket and wicket \\\\n- or if the striker has made no genuine attempt to play the ball with the bat, is \\\\n49 \\\\n- between wicket and wicket or outside the line of the off stump. \\\\n36.1.5 but for the interception, the ball would have hit the wicket. \\\\n36.2 Interception of the ball \\\\n36.2.1 In assessing points of impact in clauses 36.1.3, 36.1.4 and 36.1.5, only the first interception is to be \\\\nconsidered. \\\\n36.2.2 In assessing clause 36.1.3, if the bowler’s end umpire is not satisfied that the ball intercepted the batter’s \\\\nperson before it touched the bat, the batter shall be given Not out. \\\\n36.2.3 In assessing clause 36.1.5, it is to be assumed that the path of the ball before interception would have \\\\ncontinued after interception, irrespective of whether the ball might have pitched subsequently or not. \\\\n36.3 Off side of wicket \\\\nThe off side of the striker’s wicket shall be determined by the striker’s batting position at the moment the ball comes \\\\ninto play for that delivery. See paragraph 13 of Appendix A. \\\\n37 OBSTRUCTING THE FIELD \\\\n37.1 Out Obstructing the field \\\\n37.1.1 Either batter is out Obstructing the field if, except in the circumstances of clause 37.2, and while the ball is in \\\\nplay, he willfully attempts to obstruct or distract the fielding side by word or action. See also clause 34 (Hit \\\\nthe ball twice). \\\\n37.1.2 The striker is out Obstructing the field if, except in the circumstances of clause 37.2, in the act of receiving a \\\\nball delivered by the bowler, he willfully strikes the ball with a hand not holding the bat. This will apply \\\\nwhether it is the first strike or a second or subsequent strike. The act of receiving the ball shall extend both \\\\nto playing at the ball and to striking the ball more than once in defence of his wicket. \\\\n37.1.3 This clause will apply whether or not No ball is called. \\\\n37.1.4 For the avoidance of doubt, if an umpire feels that a batter, in running between the wickets, has significantly \\\\nchanged his direction without probable cause and thereby obstructed a fielder’s attempt to effect a run out, \\\\nthe batter should, on appeal, be given out, obstructing the field. It shall not be relevant whether a run out \\\\nwould have occurred or not. \\\\nIf the change of direction involves the batter crossing the pitch, clause 41.14 shall also apply. \\\\nSee also paragraph Error! Reference source not found. of Appendix D. \\\\n37.2 Not out Obstructing the field \\\\nA batter shall not be out Obstructing the field if \\\\nobstruction or distraction is accidental, or \\\\nobstruction is in order to avoid injury, or \\\\nin the case of the striker, he makes a second or subsequent strike to guard his wicket lawfully as in clause 34.3 (Ball \\\\nlawfully struck more than once). However, see clause 37.3. \\\\n37.3 Obstructing a ball from being caught \\\\n37.3.1    If the delivery is not a No ball, the striker is out Obstructing the field if willful obstruction or distraction by \\\\neither batter prevents the striker being out caught.    \\\\n37.3.2    Clause 37.3.1 shall apply even if an obstruction is caused by the striker in lawfully guarding his wicket under \\\\nthe provision of Clause 34.3 (Ball lawfully struck more than once). \\\\n50 \\\\n37.3.3    If an obstruction or distraction takes place from a No ball then the batter who caused the obstruction or \\\\ndistraction will be out Obstructing the field.  \\\\nHowever, the striker is not out if the obstruction of a catch occurs while defending his/her wicket from a No \\\\nball with a lawful second strike. \\\\n37.4 Returning the ball to a fielder \\\\nEither batter is out Obstructing the field if, at any time while the ball is in play and, without the consent of a fielder, he \\\\nuses the bat or any part of his person to return the ball to any fielder. \\\\n37.5 Runs scored \\\\nWhen either batter is dismissed Obstructing the field, \\\\n37.5.1 unless the obstruction or distraction prevents the striker being out caught, any runs completed by the batters \\\\nbefore the offence shall be scored, together with any one run Penalty for No ball or wide, or any other award \\\\nof 5 Penalty Runs to either side. See clauses 18.6 (Runs awarded for penalties) and 18.8 (Runs scored \\\\nwhen a batter is dismissed). \\\\n37.5.2 if the obstruction or distraction prevents the striker being out caught, any runs completed by the batters shall \\\\nnot be scored but any  award of 5 Penalty Runs to either side shall stand. Clause 18.11 (Batter returning to \\\\noriginal end) will apply. \\\\n37.6 Bowler does not get credit \\\\nThe bowler does not get credit for the wicket. \\\\n38 RUN OUT \\\\n38.1 Out Run out \\\\nEither batter is out Run out, except as in clause 38.2, if, at any time while the ball is in play: \\\\n- he is out of his ground \\\\n- and his wicket is fairly broken by either the action of a fielder or \\\\n- the ball rebounding off a fielder’s person \\\\n- even though No ball has been called, except in the circumstances of clause 38.2.2.2, and \\\\nwhether or not a run is being attempted. \\\\n38.2 Batter not out Run out \\\\n38.2.1 A batter is not out Run out in the circumstances of clauses 38.2.1.1 or 38.2.1.2. \\\\n38.2.1.1 He has been within his ground and has subsequently left it to avoid injury, when the wicket is \\\\nbroken. \\\\nNote also the provisions of clause 30.1.2 (When out of his ground). \\\\n38.2.1.2 The ball delivered by the bowler has not made contact with a fielder, before the wicket is put down. \\\\n38.2.2 The striker is not out Run out in any of the circumstances in clauses 38.2.2.1 and 38.2.2.2. \\\\n38.2.2.1 He is out Stumped. See clause 39.1.2 (Out Stumped). \\\\n38.2.2.2 No ball has been called: \\\\n- and he is out of his ground not attempting a run \\\\n- and the wicket is fairly broken by the wicket-keeper without the intervention of another fielder. \\\\n51 \\\\n38.3 Non-striker leaving his/her ground early \\\\n38.3.1   If the non -striker is ou t of his/her ground at any time from the moment the ball  comes into \\\\nplay until the instant when the bowler would normally have been expected to  release the ball , the \\\\nnon-striker is liable to be Run out by the bowler attempting to run him /her out. In these \\\\ncircumstances, the non - striker will be out Run out if he/she is out of his/her ground when his/her \\\\nwicket is broken  by the bowler throwing the b all at the wicket or  by the bowler’s hand holding the \\\\nball, whether or not the ball is subsequently delivered. \\\\n38.3.2 If the ball is not delivered, \\\\n- if there is an appeal, the umpire shall make his/her decision on the Run \\\\nout.  \\\\n- if there is no appeal, or if the decision is not out, he/she shall call and signal \\\\nDead ball as soon as possible. \\\\n- the ball shall not count as one in the over. \\\\n38.3.3 If the ball is delivered and there is an appeal, \\\\n- the umpire shall make his/her decision on the Run out. \\\\n- if the non-striker is not dismissed, the ball remains in play and clause \\\\n21.6 (Bowler breaking wicket in delivering ball) shall apply. \\\\n-  if the non-striker is dismissed, the ball shall not count as one in the over. \\\\n \\\\n38.4 Which batter is out \\\\nThe batter out in the circumstances of clause 38.1 is the one whose ground is at the end where the wicket is put \\\\ndown. See clause 30.2 (Which is a batter’s ground). \\\\n38.5 Runs scored \\\\nIf either batter is dismissed Run out, the run in progress when the wicket is put down shall not be scored, but any \\\\nruns completed by the batters shall stand, together with any runs for penalties awarded to either side. See clauses \\\\n18.6 (Runs awarded for penalties) and 18.8 (Runs scored when a batter is dismissed). \\\\n38.6 Bowler does not get credit \\\\nThe bowler does not get credit for the wicket. \\\\n39 STUMPED \\\\n39.1 Out Stumped \\\\n39.1.1 The striker is out Stumped, except as in clause 39.3, if \\\\n- a ball which is delivered is not called No ball \\\\n- and he is out of his ground, other than as in clause 39.3.1 \\\\n- and he has not attempted a run \\\\n- when his wicket is fairly broken by the wicket-keeper without the intervention of another fielder. \\\\nNote, however clause 27.3 (Position of wicket-keeper). \\\\n39.1.2 The striker is out Stumped if all the conditions of clause 39.1.1 are satisfied, even though a decision of Run \\\\nout would be justified. \\\\n52 \\\\n39.2 Ball rebounding from wicket-keeper’s person \\\\nIf the wicket is broken by the ball, it shall be regarded as having been put down by the wicket-keeper if the ball \\\\nrebounds on to the stumps from any part of the wicket-keeper’s person or equipment or has been kicked or thrown on \\\\nto the stumps by the wicket-keeper. \\\\n39.3 Not out Stumped \\\\n39.3.1 The striker will not be out Stumped if, after having received the delivery, he has left his ground in order to \\\\navoid injury. \\\\n39.3.2 If the striker is not out Stumped he may, except in the circumstances of clause 38.2.2.2 (Batter not out run \\\\nout) be out Run out if the conditions of clause 38.1 (Out Run out) apply. \\\\n                                         39.4 Runs Scored \\\\nWhen a striker is dismissed Stumped from a Wide ball, the one-run penalty shall stand. Note clauses 12.9 \\\\n(Conclusion of match), 16.6 (Winning hit or extras) and 22.2 (Call and signal of Wide ball) mean that if the penalty for \\\\na Wide concludes the match, then a stumping is not possible, but the one-run penalty for the Wide remains. \\\\n \\\\n40 TIMED OUT \\\\n40.1 Out Timed out \\\\n40.1.1 After the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, the incoming batter must, unless Time has been called, \\\\nbe ready to receive the ball or for the other batter to be ready to receive the next ball within 2 minutes of the \\\\ndismissal or retirement. If this requirement is not met, the incoming batter will be out, Timed out. \\\\n40.1.2 In the event of an extended delay in which no batter comes to the wicket, the umpires shall adopt the \\\\nprocedure of clause 16.2 (ICC Tournament Referee awarding a match). For the purposes of that clause the \\\\nstart of the action shall be taken as the expiry of the 2 minutes referred to above. \\\\n40.2 Bowler does not get credit \\\\nThe bowler does not get credit for the wicket. \\\\n41 UNFAIR PLAY \\\\n41.1 Fair and unfair play – responsibility of captains \\\\nThe captains are responsible for ensuring that play is conducted within the Spirit of Cricket, as well as within these \\\\nPlaying Conditions. \\\\n41.2 Fair and unfair play – responsibility of umpires \\\\n41.2.1 The umpires shall be the sole judges of fair and unfair play. If either umpire considers that any action by a \\\\nplayer, not covered by these Playing Conditions, is unfair, he/she shall call and signal Dead ball, if \\\\nappropriate, as soon as it becomes clear that the call will not disadvantage the non-offending side, and \\\\nreport the matter to the other umpire.  \\\\n41.2.1.1 If this is a first offence by that side, the bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- summon the offending player’s captain and issue a first and final warning which shall apply to all members of the \\\\nteam for the remainder of the match. \\\\n- warn the offending player’s captain that any further such offence by any member of his team shall result in the \\\\naward of 5 Penalty runs to the opposing team. \\\\n41.2.1.2 If this is a second or subsequent offence by that side the bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n53 \\\\n- summon the offending player’s captain and inform him that there has been a further such offence. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side. \\\\n41.2.1.3 The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Tournament Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the player concerned. \\\\n41.3 The match ball – changing its condition \\\\n41.3.1 The umpires shall make frequent and irregular inspections of the ball. In addition, they shall immediately \\\\ninspect the ball if they suspect anyone of attempting to change the condition of the ball, except as permitted \\\\nin clause 41.3.2. \\\\n41.3.2 It is an offence for any player to take any action which changes the condition of the ball. \\\\nExcept in carrying out his normal duties, a batter is not allowed to willfully damage the ball other than, when \\\\nthe ball is in play, in striking it with the bat. See also clause 5.5 (Damage to the ball). \\\\nA fielder may, however: \\\\n41.3.2.1 polish the ball on his clothing provided that no artificial substance is used, that the only natural \\\\nsubstance used is sweat, and that such polishing wastes no time. \\\\n41.3.2.2 remove mud from the ball under the supervision of an umpire. \\\\n41.3.2.3 dry a wet ball on a piece of cloth that has been approved by the umpires. \\\\n41.3.3 The umpires shall consider the condition of the ball to have been unfairly changed if any action by any \\\\nplayer does not comply with the conditions in clause 41.3.2. \\\\n41.3.4 If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly changed by a member or \\\\nmembers of either side, or that its condition is inconsistent with the use it has received, they shall consider \\\\nthat there has been a contravention of this clause and decide together whether they can identify the \\\\nplayer(s) responsible for such conduct. \\\\n41.3.5 If it is possible to identify the player(s) responsible for changing the condition of the ball, the umpires shall: \\\\n41.3.5.1 Subject to clause 41.3.2 above, change the ball forthwith.  \\\\n41.3.5.1.1 If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly changed \\\\nby a member or members of the fielding side, the batter at the wicket shall choose the \\\\nreplacement ball from a selection of six other balls of various degrees of usage \\\\n(including a new ball) and of the same brand as the ball in use prior to the \\\\ncontravention. \\\\n41.3.5.1.2 If the umpires together agree that the condition of the ball has been unfairly changed \\\\nby a member or members of the batting side, the umpires shall select and bring into \\\\nuse immediately, a ball which shall have wear comparable to that of the previous ball \\\\nimmediately prior to the contravention. \\\\n41.3.5.2 Additionally, the bowler’s end umpire shall: \\\\n41.3.5.2.1 award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing side; \\\\n41.3.5.2.2 if appropriate, inform the batters at the wicket and the captain of the fielding side that \\\\nthe ball has been changed and the reason for their action; and \\\\n41.3.5.2.3 inform the captain of the batting side as soon as practicable of what has occurred. \\\\n41.3.5.3 The umpires shall then report the matter to the ICC Tournament Referee who shall take \\\\nsuch action as is considered appropriate against the player(s) concerned. \\\\n41.3.6 If it is not possible to identify the player(s) responsible for changing the condition of the ball, the umpires \\\\nshall: \\\\n54 \\\\n41.3.6.1 Change the ball forthwith. The umpires shall choose the replacement ball for one of similar wear \\\\nand of the same brand as the ball in use prior to the contravention; \\\\n41.3.6.2 The bowler’s end umpire shall issue the captain with a first and final warning, and \\\\n41.3.6.3 Advise the captain that should there be any further instances of changing the condition of the ball \\\\nby that team during the remainder of the series, clause 41.3.5.1.2 above will be adopted, with the \\\\ncaptain deemed to be the player responsible for the contravention. \\\\n41.4 Deliberate attempt to distract striker \\\\n41.4.1 It is unfair for any fielder deliberately to attempt to distract the striker while he is preparing to receive or \\\\nreceiving a delivery. \\\\n41.4.2 If either umpire considers that any action by a fielder is such an attempt, he/she shall immediately call and \\\\nsignal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for the call. The bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side, the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting \\\\nside of the reason for the action. \\\\nNeither batter shall be dismissed from that delivery and the ball shall not count as one of the over. However, \\\\nif either umpire had reason to call and signal No ball, he/she shall do so regardless of the attempt to distract, \\\\nand this call shall stand \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Tournament Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the fielder concerned.  \\\\n41.5 Deliberate distraction, deception or obstruction of batter \\\\n41.5.1 In addition to clause 41.4, it is unfair for any fielder willfully to attempt, by word or action, to distract, deceive \\\\nor obstruct either batter after the striker has received the ball. \\\\n41.5.2 It is for either one of the umpires to decide whether any distraction, deception or obstruction is willful or not. \\\\n41.5.3 If either umpire considers that a fielder has caused or attempted to cause such a distraction, deception or \\\\nobstruction, he/she shall immediately call and signal Dead ball and inform the other umpire of the reason for \\\\nthe call. \\\\n41.5.4 Neither batter shall be dismissed from that delivery. \\\\n41.5.5 If an obstruction involves physical contact, the umpires together shall decide whether or not an offence \\\\nunder clause 42 (Players’ conduct) has been committed. \\\\n41.5.5.1 If an offence under clause 42 (Players’ conduct) has been committed, they shall apply the relevant \\\\nprocedures in clause 42 and shall also apply each of clauses 41.5.7 to 41.5.9. \\\\n41.5.5.2 If they consider that there has been no offence under clause 42 (Players’ conduct), they shall apply \\\\neach of clauses 41.5.6 to 41.5.10. \\\\n41.5.6 The bowler’s end umpire shall; \\\\n- Signal No ball or Wide to the scorers, if applicable. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side of the reason for this action and as soon as practicable inform the \\\\ncaptain of the batting side. \\\\n41.5.7 The ball shall not count as one of the over. \\\\n41.5.8 Any runs completed by the batters before the offence shall be scored, together with any runs for penalties \\\\nawarded to either side. Additionally, the run in progress shall be scored whether or not the batters had \\\\nalready crossed at the instant of the offence. \\\\n55 \\\\n41.5.9 The batters at the wicket shall decide which of them is to face the next delivery. \\\\n41.5.10 The umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Tournament Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the fielder concerned. \\\\n41.6 Bowling of dangerous and unfair short pitched deliveries \\\\n41.6.1 Notwithstanding clause 41.6.2, the bowling of short pitched deliveries is dangerous if the bowler’s end \\\\numpire considers that, taking into consideration the skill of the striker, by their speed, length, height and \\\\ndirection they are likely to inflict physical injury on him. The fact that the striker is wearing protective \\\\nequipment shall be disregarded. \\\\nIn the first instance the umpire decides that the bowling of short pitched deliveries has become dangerous \\\\nunder clause 41.6.1 \\\\n41.6.1.1 The umpire shall call and signal No ball, and when the ball is dead, caution the bowler and inform \\\\nthe other umpire, the captain of the fielding side and the batters of what has occurred. This caution \\\\nshall apply to that bowler throughout the innings. \\\\n41.6.1.2 If there is a second instance, the umpire shall repeat the above procedure and indicate to the \\\\nbowler that this is a final warning, which shall apply to that bowler throughout the innings. \\\\n41.6.1.3 Should there be any further instance by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall \\\\n- call and signal No ball \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately \\\\nfrom bowling \\\\n- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any \\\\npart of the previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\n- The umpire shall inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting \\\\nside. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Tournament Referee who shall take such \\\\naction as is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.6.1.4 A bowler shall be limited to two fast short-pitched deliveries per over. \\\\n41.6.1.5 A fast short-pitched delivery is defined as a ball, which passes or would have passed above the \\\\nshoulder height of the striker standing upright at the popping crease. \\\\n41.6.1.6 The umpire at the bowler’s end shall advise the bowler and the batter on strike when each fast short \\\\npitched delivery has been bowled. \\\\n41.6.1.7 In addition, a ball that passes above head height of the batter, standing upright at the popping \\\\ncrease, that prevents him from being able to hit it with his bat by means of a normal cricket stroke \\\\nshall be called a Wide. See also clause 22.1.1.2 \\\\n41.6.1.7.1 For the avoidance of doubt any fast short pitched delivery that is called a Wide under this clause shall \\\\nalso count as one of the allowable short pitched deliveries in that over. \\\\n41.6.1.8 In the event of a bowler bowling more than two fast short-pitched deliveries in an over as defined in \\\\nclause 41.6.1.5 above, the umpire at the bowler’s end shall call and signal No ball on each \\\\noccasion. A differential signal shall be used to signify a fast short pitched delivery. The umpire shall \\\\ncall and signal ‘No ball’ and then tap the head with the other hand. \\\\n41.6.1.9 If a bowler delivers a third fast short pitched ball in an over, the umpire, after the call of No ball and \\\\nwhen the ball is dead, shall caution the bowler, inform the other umpire, the captain of the fielding \\\\nside and the batters at the wicket of what has occurred. This caution shall apply throughout the \\\\ninnings. \\\\n56 \\\\n41.6.1.10 If there is a second instance of the bowler being No balled in the innings for bowling more than two \\\\nfast short pitched deliveries in an over, the umpire shall advise the bowler that this is his final \\\\nwarning for the innings. \\\\n41.6.1.11 Should there be any further instance by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall \\\\n- call and signal No ball \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately \\\\nfrom bowling \\\\n- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any \\\\npart of the previous over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\n- The umpire shall inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting \\\\nside. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Tournament Referee who shall take such \\\\naction as is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.6.2 Should the umpires initiate the caution and warning procedures set out in clauses 41.6.1.3 and 41.7 such \\\\ncautions and warnings are not to be cumulative. \\\\n41.7 Bowling of dangerous and unfair non-pitching deliveries \\\\n41.7.1 Any delivery, which passes or would have passed, without pitching, above waist height of the striker \\\\nstanding upright at the popping crease, is to be deemed to be unfair, whether or not it is likely to inflict \\\\nphysical injury on the striker. If the bowler bowls such a delivery the umpire shall immediately call and signal \\\\nNo ball. \\\\nIf, in the opinion of the umpire, such a delivery is considered likely to inflict physical injury on the batter by its \\\\nspeed and direction, it shall be considered dangerous. When the ball is dead the umpire shall caution the \\\\nbowler, indicating that this is a first and final warning. The umpire shall also inform the other umpire, the \\\\ncaptain of the fielding side and the batters of what has occurred. This caution shall apply to that bowler \\\\nthroughout the innings. \\\\n41.7.2 Should there be any further instance (where a dangerous non-pitching delivery is bowled and is considered \\\\nlikely to inflict physical injury on the batter) by the same bowler in that innings, the umpire shall \\\\n- call and signal No ball \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from \\\\nbowling \\\\n- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the \\\\nprevious over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\nAdditionally the umpire shall \\\\n- report the occurrence to the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Tournament Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.7.3 The warning sequence in clauses 41.7.1 and 41.7.2 is independent of the warning and action sequence in \\\\nclause 41.6. \\\\n57 \\\\n41.7.4 If the umpire considers that a bowler deliberately bowled a high full-pitched delivery, deemed to be \\\\ndangerous and unfair as defined in clause 41.7.1, then the caution and warning in clause 41.7.1 shall be \\\\ndispensed with. The umpire shall \\\\n- immediately call and signal No ball. \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from \\\\nbowling and inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the \\\\nprevious over, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\n- report the occurrence to the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Tournament Referee who shall take such action \\\\nas is considered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.8 Bowling of deliberate front-foot No ball \\\\nIf the umpire considers that the bowler has delivered a deliberate front-foot No ball, he/she shall \\\\n- immediately call and signal No ball. \\\\n- when the ball is dead, direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling \\\\n- inform the other umpire for the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler thus suspended shall not be allowed to bowl again in that innings. \\\\nIf applicable, the over shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the previous \\\\nover, nor be allowed to bowl any part of the next over. \\\\n- report the occurrence to the batters and, as soon as practicable, to the captain of the batting side. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Tournament Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.9 Time wasting by the fielding side \\\\n41.9.1 It is unfair for any fielder to waste time. \\\\n41.9.2 If either umpire considers that the progress of an over is unnecessarily slow, or time is being wasted in any \\\\nother way, by the captain of the fielding side or by any other fielder, at the first instance the umpire \\\\nconcerned shall \\\\n- if the ball is in play, call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of what has occurred. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- warn the captain of the fielding side, indicating that this is a first and final warning. \\\\n- inform the batters of what has occurred. \\\\n41.9.3 If either umpire considers that there is any further waste of time in that innings by any fielder, the umpire \\\\nconcerned shall \\\\n- if the ball is in play, call and signal Dead ball. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of what has occurred. \\\\n58 \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side and inform the captain of the \\\\nfielding side of the reason for this action. \\\\nAdditionally the umpire shall inform the batters and, as soon as is practicable, the captain of the batting side \\\\nof what has occurred. \\\\nIf the umpires believe that the act of time wasting was deliberate or repetitive, they may lodge a report under \\\\nthe ICC Code of Conduct. In such circumstances the Captain and/or any individual members of the fielding \\\\nteam responsible for the time wasting will be charged. \\\\n \\\\n41.10 Batter wasting time \\\\n41.10.1 It is unfair for a batter to waste time. In normal circumstances, the striker should always be ready to take \\\\nstrike when the bowler is ready to start his run-up. \\\\nIn addition, an incoming batter should be in position to take guard or his partner ready to receive the next \\\\nball within 2 minutes of the fall of the previous wicket. \\\\n41.10.2 Should either batter waste time by failing to meet this requirement, or in any other way, the following \\\\nprocedure shall be adopted. At the first instance, either before the bowler starts his run-up or when the ball \\\\nbecomes dead, as appropriate, the umpire shall \\\\n- warn both batters and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall apply throughout the \\\\ninnings. The umpire shall so inform each incoming batter. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of what has occurred. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what \\\\nhas occurred. \\\\n41.10.3 If there is any further time wasting by any batter in that innings, the umpire shall, at the appropriate time \\\\nwhile the ball is dead \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the other batter, the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the \\\\nbatting side of what has occurred. \\\\nIf the umpires believe that the act of time wasting was deemed to be deliberate or repetitive, they may lodge \\\\na report under the ICC Code of Conduct. In such circumstances the batter concerned will be charged. \\\\n41.11 The protected area \\\\nThe protected area is defined as that area of the pitch contained within a rectangle bounded at each end by \\\\nimaginary lines parallel to the popping creases and 5 ft/1.52 m in front of each, and on the sides by imaginary lines, \\\\none each side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps, each parallel to it and 1 ft/30.48 cm \\\\nfrom it. \\\\n41.12 Fielder damaging the pitch \\\\n41.12.1 It is unfair to cause deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch. A fielder will be deemed to be causing \\\\navoidable damage if either umpire considers that his presence on the pitch is without reasonable cause. \\\\n41.12.2 If a fielder causes deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch, other than as in clause 41.13.1, at the first \\\\ninstance the umpire seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire. The \\\\nbowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- caution the captain of the fielding side and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning shall \\\\napply throughout the innings. \\\\n59 \\\\n- inform the batters of what has occurred. \\\\n41.12.3 If, in that innings, there is any further instance of deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch, by any fielder, \\\\nthe umpire seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire. The bowler’s end \\\\numpire shall then \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the batting side. \\\\nAdditionally the umpire shall \\\\n- inform the fielding captain of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Tournament Referee who shall take such action \\\\nas is considered appropriate against the fielder concerned. \\\\n41.13 Bowler running on protected area \\\\n41.13.1 It is unfair for a bowler to enter the protected area in his follow-through without reasonable cause, whether or \\\\nnot the ball is delivered. \\\\n41.13.2 If a bowler contravenes this clause, at the first instance and when the ball is dead, the umpire shall \\\\n- caution the bowler and inform the other umpire of what has occurred. This caution shall apply to that \\\\nbowler throughout the innings. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and the batters of what has occurred. \\\\n41.13.3 If, in that innings, the same bowler again contravenes this clause, the umpire shall repeat the above \\\\nprocedure indicating that this is a final warning. This warning shall also apply throughout the innings. \\\\n41.13.4 If, in that innings, the same bowler contravenes this clause a third time, when the ball is dead, the umpire \\\\nshall, \\\\n- direct the captain of the fielding side to suspend the bowler immediately from bowling. If applicable, the \\\\nover shall be completed by another bowler, who shall neither have bowled any part of the previous over, nor \\\\nbe allowed to bowl any part of the next over. The bowler taken off shall not be allowed to bowl again in that \\\\ninnings. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of the reason for this action. \\\\n- inform the batters and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what has occurred. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Tournament Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the bowler concerned. \\\\n41.14 Batter damaging the pitch \\\\n41.14.1 It is unfair to cause deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch. If the striker enters the protected area in \\\\nplaying or playing at the ball, he must move from it immediately thereafter. A batter will be deemed to be \\\\ncausing avoidable damage if either umpire considers that his presence on the pitch is without reasonable \\\\ncause. \\\\n41.14.2 If either batter causes deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch, other than as in clause 41.15, at the first \\\\ninstance the umpire seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the \\\\noccurrence. The bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- warn both batters that the practice is unfair and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning \\\\nshall apply throughout the innings. The umpire shall so inform each incoming batter. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what \\\\nhas occurred. \\\\n60 \\\\n41.14.3 If there is any further instance of deliberate or avoidable damage to the pitch by any batter in that innings, \\\\nthe umpire seeing the contravention shall, when the ball is dead, inform the other umpire of the occurrence. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\\\n- return any not out batter to his original end \\\\n- signal No ball or Wide to the scorers if applicable. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. \\\\n- award any other 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective \\\\nhelmets belonging to the fielding side). \\\\n- Inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the \\\\nreason for this action. \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Tournament Referee who shall take such action \\\\nas is considered appropriate against the batter concerned. \\\\n41.15 Striker in protected area \\\\n41.15.1 The striker shall not adopt a batting position in the protected area or so close to it that frequent \\\\nencroachment is inevitable. \\\\nThe striker may make a mark on the pitch for the purpose of indicating his/her batting position provided that \\\\nno mark is unreasonably close to the protected area. \\\\n41.15.2 If either umpire considers that the striker is in breach of any of the conditions in clause 41.15.1, if the bowler \\\\nhas not entered the delivery stride, he/she shall immediately call Dead ball, otherwise, wait until the ball is \\\\ndead; he/she shall then inform the other umpire of the occurrence. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- warn the striker that the practice is unfair and indicate that this is a first and final warning. This warning \\\\nshall apply throughout the innings. The umpire shall so inform the non-striker and each incoming batter. \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of what \\\\nhas occurred. \\\\n41.15.3 If there is any further breach of any of the conditions in clause 41.15.1 by any batter in that innings, the \\\\numpire seeing the contravention shall, if the bowler has not entered his delivery stride, immediately call and \\\\nsignal Dead ball, otherwise, he/she shall wait until the ball is dead and then inform the other umpire of the \\\\noccurrence. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall \\\\n- disallow all runs to the batting side \\\\n- return any not out batter to his original end \\\\n- signal No ball or Wide to the scorers if applicable. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. \\\\n- award any other 5-run Penalty that is applicable except for Penalty runs under clause 28.3 (Protective \\\\nhelmets belonging to the fielding side). \\\\n- inform the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting side of the \\\\nreason for this action. \\\\n61 \\\\nThe umpires together shall report the occurrence to the ICC Tournament Referee who shall take such action \\\\nas is considered appropriate against the batter concerned. \\\\n41.16 Batters stealing a run \\\\n41.16.1 It is unfair for the batters to attempt to steal a run during the bowler’s run-up. \\\\nUnless the bowler attempts to run out the non-striker – see clause 38.3 (Non-striker leaving his/her ground \\\\nearly) – the umpire shall \\\\n- call and signal Dead ball as soon as the batters cross in such an attempt. \\\\n- inform the other umpire of the reason for this action. \\\\nThe bowler’s end umpire shall then \\\\n- return the batters to their original ends and disallow the attempted run. \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the fielding side. \\\\n-  award any other 5 run Penalty that is applicable \\\\n- inform the batters, the captain of the fielding side and, as soon as practicable, the captain of the batting \\\\nside, of the reason for this action. \\\\nThe umpires may then report the matter to the ICC Tournament Referee who shall take such action as is \\\\nconsidered appropriate against the batter concerned. \\\\n41.17 Penalty runs \\\\n41.17.1 When Penalty runs are awarded to either side, when the ball is dead the umpire shall signal the Penalty runs \\\\nto the scorers. See clause 2.13 (Signals). \\\\n41.17.2 Penalty runs shall be awarded in each case where these Playing Conditions require the award, even if a \\\\nresult has already been achieved. See clause 16.6 (Winning hit or extras). \\\\nNote, however, that the restrictions on awarding Penalty runs, in clauses 23.3 (Leg byes not to be awarded), \\\\n34.4 (Runs scored from ball lawfully struck more than once) and 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the \\\\nfielding side), will apply. \\\\n41.17.3 When 5 Penalty runs are awarded to the batting side under any of clauses 24.4 (Player returning without \\\\npermission), 28.2 (Fielding the ball), 28.3 (Protective helmets belonging to the fielding side) or under 41.3, \\\\n41.4, 41.5, 41.9 or 41.12, then \\\\n- they shall be scored as Penalty extras and shall be in addition to any other penalties. \\\\n- they are awarded when the ball is dead and shall not be regarded as runs scored from either the \\\\nimmediately preceding delivery or the immediately following delivery, and shall be in addition to any runs \\\\nfrom those deliveries. \\\\n- the batters shall not change ends solely by reason of the 5 run penalty. \\\\n41.17.4 When 5 Penalty runs are awarded to the fielding side, under clause 18.5.2 (Deliberate short runs), or under \\\\n41.10, 41.14, 41.15 or 41.16, they shall be added as Penalty extras to that side’s total of runs in its most \\\\nrecently completed innings. If the fielding side has not completed an innings, the 5 Penalty runs shall be \\\\nadded to the score in its next innings. \\\\n42 PLAYERS’ CONDUCT \\\\n42.1 Serious misconduct \\\\n42.1.1 The umpires shall act upon any serious misconduct. The relevant offences and the corresponding actions by \\\\nthe umpires are identified in clause 42.2.1. These offences correspond with Level 4 offences in the ICC \\\\n62 \\\\nCode of Conduct. Level 1 to Level 3 offences continue to be dealt with separately under the ICC Code of \\\\nConduct. \\\\n42.1.2 If either umpire considers that a player has committed one of these offences at any time during the match, \\\\nthe umpire concerned shall call and signal Dead ball. This call may be delayed until the umpire is satisfied \\\\nthat it will not disadvantage the non-offending side. \\\\n42.1.3 The umpire concerned shall report the matter to the other umpire and together they shall decide whether an \\\\noffence has been committed. The umpires may also consult with the third umpire and the match referee, \\\\nwho may review any audio or video replays to confirm whether an offence has been committed. If so, the \\\\numpires shall then apply the related sanctions. \\\\n42.1.4 Any call of No ball or Wide before the offence shall stand \\\\n42.1.5 If the offence is committed by a batter, the umpires shall summon the offending player’s captain to the field. \\\\nSolely for the purpose of this clause, the batters at the wicket may not deputise for their captain. \\\\n42.2 Level 4 offences and action by umpires \\\\n42.2.1 Any of the following actions by a player shall constitute a Level 4 offence: \\\\n- threatening to assault an umpire \\\\n- making inappropriate and deliberate physical contact with an umpire \\\\n- physically assaulting a player or any other person \\\\n- committing any other act of violence. \\\\n42.2.2 If such an offence is committed, 42.2.2.1 to 42.2.2.5 shall be implemented. \\\\n42.2.2.1 The umpire shall call Time. \\\\n42.2.2.2 Together the umpires shall summon and inform the offending player’s captain that an offence at this \\\\nLevel has occurred. \\\\n42.2.2.3 The umpires shall instruct the captain to remove the offending player immediately from the field of \\\\nplay for the remainder of the match and shall apply the following: \\\\n42.2.2.3.1 If the offending player is a fielder, no substitute shall be allowed for him. He is to be recorded as Retired \\\\n– out at the commencement of any subsequent innings in which his team is the batting side. \\\\n42.2.2.3.2 If a bowler is suspended mid-over, then that over must be completed by a different bowler, who shall not \\\\nhave bowled the previous over nor shall be permitted to bowl the next over. \\\\n42.2.2.3.3 If the offending player is a batter he is to be recorded as Retired – out in the current innings, unless he \\\\nhas been dismissed under any of clauses 32 to 39, and at the commencement of any subsequent \\\\ninnings in which his team is the batting side. If no further batter is available to bat, the innings is \\\\ncompleted. \\\\n42.2.2.4 As soon as practicable, the umpire shall: \\\\n- award 5 Penalty runs to the opposing team \\\\n- signal the Level 4 penalty to the scorers \\\\n- call Play. \\\\n42.2.2.5 The umpires shall then report the matter to the ICC Tournament Referee under the ICC Code of \\\\nConduct. \\\\n42.3 Captain refusing to remove a player from the field \\\\n42.3.1 If a captain refuses to carry out an instruction under 42.2.2.3, the umpires shall invoke clause 16.2 (ICC \\\\nTournament Referee awarding a match). \\\\n63 \\\\n42.3.2 If both captains refuse to carry out instructions under 42.2.2.3 in respect of the same incident, the umpires \\\\nshall instruct the players to leave the field.

For the purposes of \\\\ninterpreting these Playing Conditions, such a description will include \\\\nfaceguards head, neck and/or face grilles and neck guards. \\\\n2.4 Equipment – a batter’s equipment is his bat as defined above, together with any \\\\nexternal protective equipment he is wearing. \\\\nA fielder’s equipment is any external protective equipment that he is wearing. \\\\n2.5 The bat – the following are to be considered as part of the bat: \\\\n- the whole of the bat itself. \\\\n- the whole of a glove (or gloves) worn on the hand (or hands) holding the bat. \\\\n- the hand (or hands) holding the bat, if the batter is not wearing a glove on that hand or on those \\\\nhands. \\\\n2.6 Held in batter’s hand.  Contact between a batter’s hand, or glove worn on his \\\\nhand, and any part of the bat shall constitute the bat being held in that hand. \\\\n3 The playing area \\\\n3.1 The field of play is the area contained within the boundary. \\\\n3.2 The square is a specially prepared area of the field of play within which the \\\\nmatch pitch is situated. \\\\n3.3 The outfield is that part of the field of play between the square and the \\\\nboundary. \\\\n4 Positioning \\\\n4.1 Behind the popping crease at one end of the pitch is that area of the field of \\\\nplay, including any other marking, objects and persons therein, that is on that \\\\nside of the popping crease that does not include the creases at the opposite \\\\nend of the pitch.  Behind, in relation to any other marking, object or person, \\\\nfollows the same principle.  See the diagram in paragraph 13.  \\\\n4.2 In front of the popping crease at one end of the pitch is that area of the field of \\\\nplay, including any other marking, objects and persons therein, that is on that \\\\nside of the popping crease that includes the creases at the opposite end of the \\\\npitch.  In front of, in relation to any other marking, object or person, follows the \\\\nsame principle.  See the diagram in paragraph 13. \\\\n4.3 The striker’s end is the place where the striker stands to receive a delivery from \\\\nthe bowler only insofar as it identifies, independently of where the striker may \\\\nsubsequently move, one end of the pitch.  \\\\n4.4 The bowler’s end is the end from which the bowler delivers the ball.  It is the \\\\nother end of the pitch from the striker’s end and identifies that end of the pitch \\\\nthat is not the striker’s end as described in paragraph 4.3.  \\\\n4.5 The wicket-keeper’s end is the same as the striker’s end as described in \\\\nparagraph 4.3. \\\\n4.6 In front of the line of the striker’s wicket is in the area of the field of play in \\\\nfront of the imaginary line joining the fronts of the stumps at the striker’s end; \\\\nthis line to be considered extended in both directions to the boundary.  See \\\\nparagraph 4.2. \\\\n67 \\\\n4.7 Behind the wicket is in the area of the field of play behind the imaginary line \\\\njoining the backs of the stumps at the appropriate end; this line to be \\\\nconsidered extended in both directions to the boundary. See paragraph 4.1. \\\\n4.8 Behind the wicket-keeper is behind the wicket at the striker’s end, as defined \\\\nabove, but in line with both sets of stumps and further from the stumps than \\\\nthe wicket-keeper. \\\\n4.9 Off side/on (leg) side – see diagram in paragraph 13 \\\\n4.10 Inside edge is the edge on the same side as the nearer wicket.  \\\\n5 Umpires and decision-making \\\\n5.1 Umpire – where the description the umpire is used on its own, it always means \\\\n‘the bowler’s end umpire’ though this full description is sometimes used for \\\\nemphasis or clarity.  Similarly the umpires always means both umpires and \\\\nthe third umpire.  An umpire and umpires are generalised terms.  Otherwise, \\\\na fuller description indicates which one of the umpires is specifically intended.  \\\\nEach umpire will be bowler’s end umpire and striker’s end umpire in alternate \\\\novers.  \\\\n5.2 Bowler’s end umpire is the umpire who is standing at the bowler’s end (see \\\\nparagraph 4.4) for the current delivery. \\\\n5.3 Striker’s end umpire is the umpire who is standing at the striker’s end (see \\\\nparagraph 4.3), to one side of the pitch or the other, depending on his/her \\\\nchoice, for the current delivery.     \\\\n5.4 On-field umpires shall mean, collectively, the bowler’s end umpire and the \\\\nstriker’s end umpire. \\\\n5.5 Third umpire is the umpire who can officiate as an emergency replacement for \\\\nan on-field umpire (see 2.1.4) \\\\n5.6 Umpires together agree applies to decisions which the umpires are to make \\\\njointly, independently of the players. \\\\n5.7 A Fair Catch is a catch that has been taken cleanly by the fielder in accordance \\\\nwith clause 33. \\\\n5.8 A Bump Ball is where the ball has made contact with the ground shortly after \\\\nmaking contact with the striker’s bat. \\\\n6 Batters \\\\n6.1 Batting side is the side currently batting, whether or not play is in progress. \\\\n6.2 Member of the batting side is one of the players nominated by the captain of \\\\nthe batting side, or any authorised replacement for such nominated player. \\\\n6.3 The Striker is the batter who receives the ball delivered by the bowler. \\\\n6.4 The non-striker is the batter who ground is at the bowler’s end when the ball is \\\\ndelivered. \\\\n6.5 A batter’s ground – at each end of the pitch, the whole area of the field of play \\\\nbehind the popping crease is the ground at that end for a batter. \\\\n6.6 Original end is the end where a batter was when the ball came into play for that \\\\ndelivery. \\\\n6.7 Wicket he has left is the wicket at the end where a batter was at the start of the \\\\nrun in progress. \\\\n68 \\\\n6.8  A batting position is the position and posture adopted by the striker to receive \\\\na ball delivered by the bowler \\\\n6.9 For the purposes of these Playing Conditions, waist height is defined as the point \\\\nat which the top of the batter’s trousers would conventionally be when he is \\\\nstanding upright at the popping crease. \\\\n7 Fielders \\\\n7.1 Fielding side is the side currently fielding, whether or not play is in progress. \\\\n7.2 Member of the fielding side is one of the players nominated by the captain of \\\\nthe fielding side, or any authorised replacement or substitute for such \\\\nnominated player.  \\\\n7.3 Fielder is one of the 11 or fewer players who together represent the fielding side \\\\non the field of play. This definition includes not only both the bowler and the \\\\nwicket-keeper but also nominated players who are legitimately on the field of \\\\nplay, together with players legitimately acting as substitutes for absent \\\\nnominated players.  It excludes any nominated player who is absent from the \\\\nfield of play, or who has been absent from the field of play and who has not yet \\\\nobtained the umpire’s permission to return.  \\\\nA player going briefly outside the boundary in the course of discharging his duties as a fielder is not absent \\\\nfrom the field of play nor, for the purposes of clause 24.2 (Fielder absent or leaving the field of play), is he to \\\\nbe regarded as having left the field of play. \\\\n8 Substitutes and Concussion Replacements \\\\n8.1 A Substitute is a player who takes the place of a fielder on the field of play, but \\\\ndoes not replace the player for whom he substitutes on that side’s list of \\\\nnominated players.  A substitute’s activities are limited to fielding. \\\\n8.2 A Concussion Replacement is a player who takes the place of a player who has \\\\nbeen replaced in accordance with the process set out in clause 1.2.7, and who \\\\nfor the remainder of the match replaces that player on that side’s list of \\\\nnominated players, being able to take a full part in the match (subject to such \\\\nrestrictions as may be imposed by the ICC Tournament Referee in accordance \\\\nwith clause 1.2.7.4) \\\\n8.3 A Concussion Replacement Request is the notification made to the ICC \\\\nTournament Referee in accordance with the process set out in clause 1.2.7.3 \\\\n8.4 The Team Medical Representative is the individual designated as having \\\\nresponsibility for the assessment of any head or neck injury sustained by a \\\\nplayer as set out in clause 1.2.7.2 \\\\n9 Bowlers \\\\n9.1 Over the wicket / round the wicket – if, as the bowler runs up between the \\\\nwicket and the return crease, the wicket is on the same side as his bowling \\\\narm, he is bowling over the wicket.  If the return crease is on the same side as \\\\nhis bowling arm, he is bowling round the wicket. \\\\n9.2 Delivery swing is the motion of the bowler’s arm during which he normally \\\\nreleases the ball for a delivery. \\\\n9.3 Delivery stride is the stride during which the delivery swing is made, whether the \\\\nball is released or not.  It starts when the bowler’s back foot lands for that \\\\nstride and ends when the front foot lands in the same stride.  The stride after \\\\n69 \\\\nthe delivery stride is completed when the next foot lands, i.e. when the back \\\\nfoot of the delivery stride lands again. \\\\n9.4 The Illegal Bowling Regulations are the ICC’s regulations governing Illegal \\\\nBowling Actions. \\\\n9.5 An Illegal Bowling Action is a bowling action where a bowler’s Elbow Extension \\\\nexceeds 15 degrees, measured from the point at which the bowling arm \\\\nreaches the horizontal until the point at which the ball is released (any Elbow \\\\nHyperextension shall be discounted for the purposes of determining an Illegal \\\\nBowling Action). \\\\n9.6 Elbow Extension means the motion that occurs when a bowler\\'s arm moves \\\\nfrom a flexed (bent) position at the elbow, to a more extended (straight) \\\\nposition (full Elbow Extension occurs when the arm is straight). \\\\n9.7 Elbow Hyperextension is the motion that occurs when a bowler\\'s elbow extends \\\\nbeyond the straight position. \\\\n9.8 The ICC Bowling Action Report Form is the form provided for by Article 3 of \\\\nthe Illegal Bowling Regulations, by which an umpire and/or the ICC \\\\nTournament Referee may submit a report relating to a suspected Illegal \\\\nBowling Action. \\\\n10 The ball \\\\n10.1 The ball is struck/strikes the ball unless specifically defined otherwise, mean \\\\n‘the ball is struck by the bat’/‘strikes the ball with the bat’. \\\\n10.2 Full-pitch describes a ball delivered by the bowler that reaches or passes the \\\\nstriker without having touched the ground.  Sometimes described as non-\\\\npitching. \\\\n11 Runs \\\\n11.1 A run to be disallowed is one that in these Playing Conditions should not have \\\\nbeen taken.  It is not only to be cancelled but the batters are to be returned to \\\\ntheir original ends.   \\\\n11.2 A run not to be scored is one that is not illegal, but is not recognised as a \\\\nproperly executed run.  It is not a run that has been made, so the question of \\\\ncancellation does not arise.  The loss of the run so attempted is not a \\\\ndisallowance and the batters will not be returned to their original ends on that \\\\naccount.  \\\\n12 The person \\\\n12.1 Person; A player’s person is his physical person (flesh and blood) together with \\\\nany clothing or legitimate external protective equipment that he is wearing \\\\nexcept, in the case of a batter, his bat. \\\\nA hand, whether gloved or not, that is not holding the bat is part of the batter’s person. \\\\nNo item of clothing or equipment is part of the player’s person unless it is attached to him. \\\\nFor a batter, a glove being held but not worn is part of his person. \\\\nFor a fielder, an item of clothing or equipment he is holding in his hand or hands is not part of his person. \\\\n12.2 Clothing – anything that a player is wearing, including such items as spectacles \\\\nor jewellery, that is not classed as external protective equipment is classed as \\\\n70 \\\\nclothing, even though he may be wearing some items of apparel, which are \\\\nnot visible, for protection.  A bat being carried by a batter does not come within \\\\nthis definition of clothing. \\\\n12.3 Hand for batter or wicket-keeper shall include both the hand itself and the whole \\\\nof a glove worn on the hand. \\\\n71 \\\\n \\\\n13 Off side / on side; in front of / behind the popping crease. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n72 \\\\nAppendix B  \\\\n \\\\nEquipment  \\\\n1 The Bat \\\\n1.1 General guidance \\\\n1.1.1 Measurements - All provisions in paragraphs 1.2 to 1.6 below are subject to the measurements and \\\\nrestrictions stated in the Playing Conditions and this Appendix. \\\\n1.1.2 Adhesives – Throughout, adhesives are permitted only where essential and only in minimal quantity. \\\\n1.2 Specifications for the Handle \\\\n1.2.1 One end of the handle is inserted into a recess in the blade as a means of joining the handle and the blade. \\\\nThis lower portion is used purely for joining the blade and the handle together.  It is not part of the blade but, \\\\nsolely in interpreting paragraphs 1.3 and 1.4 below, references to the blade shall be considered to extend \\\\nalso to this lower portion of the handle where relevant. \\\\n1.2.2 The handle may be glued where necessary and bound with twine along the upper portion.  \\\\nProviding clause 5.5 is not contravened, the upper portion may be covered with materials solely to provide a \\\\nsurface suitable for gripping.  Such covering is an addition and is not part of the bat, except in relation to \\\\nclause 5.6.  The bottom of this grip should not extend below the point defined in paragraph 1.2.4 below. \\\\nTwine binding and the covering grip may extend beyond the junction of the upper and lower portions of the \\\\nhandle, to cover part of the shoulders of the bat as defined in paragraph 1.3.1. \\\\nNo material may be placed on or inserted into the lower portion of the handle other than as permitted above \\\\ntogether with the minimal adhesives or adhesive tape used solely for fixing these items, or for fixing the \\\\nhandle to the blade. \\\\n1.2.3 Materials in handle – As a proportion of the total volume of the handle, materials other than cane, wood or \\\\ntwine are restricted to one-tenth. Such materials must not project more than 3.25 in/8.26 cm into the lower \\\\nportion of the handle \\\\n1.2.4 Binding and covering of handle – The permitted continuation beyond the junction of the upper and lower \\\\nportions of the handle is restricted to a maximum, measured along the length of the handle, of \\\\n2.5 in/6.35 cm in for the twine binding \\\\n2.75 in/6.99 cm for the covering grip. \\\\n1.3 Specifications for the Blade \\\\n1.3.1 The blade has a face, a back, a toe, sides and shoulders \\\\n1.3.1.1 The face of the blade is its main striking surface and shall be flat or have a slight convex curve \\\\nresulting from traditional pressing techniques.  The back is the opposite surface. \\\\n1.3.1.2 The shoulders, sides and toe are the remaining surfaces, separating the face and the back. \\\\n1.3.1.3 The shoulders, one on each side of the handle, are along that portion of the blade between the first \\\\nentry point of the handle and the point at which the blade first reaches its full width. \\\\n1.3.1.4 The toe is the surface opposite to the shoulders taken as a pair. \\\\n1.3.1.5 The sides, one each side of the blade, are along the rest of the blade, between the toe and the \\\\nshoulders. \\\\n73 \\\\n1.3.2 No material may be placed on or inserted into the blade other than as permitted in paragraph 1.2.4, \\\\nparagraph 1.3.3, and clause 5.4 together with the minimal adhesives or adhesive tape used solely for fixing \\\\nthese items, or for fixing the handle to the blade. \\\\n1.3.3 Covering the blade. Bats shall have no covering on the blade except as permitted in clause 5.4.   \\\\nAny materials referred to above, in clause 5.4 and paragraph 1.4 below, are to be considered as part of the \\\\nbat, which must still pass through the gauge as defined in paragraph 1.6. \\\\n1.4 Protection and repair  \\\\n1.4.1 The surface of the blade may be treated with non-solid materials to improve resistance to moisture \\\\npenetration and/or mask natural blemishes in the appearance of the wood.  Save for the purpose of giving a \\\\nhomogeneous appearance by masking natural blemishes, such treatment shall not materially alter the colour \\\\nof the blade.  \\\\n1.4.2 Materials can be used for protection and repair as stated in clause 5.4 and are additional to the blade. Note \\\\nhowever clause 5.6. \\\\nAny such material shall not extend over any part of the back of the blade except in the case of clause 5.4.1 \\\\nand then only when it is applied as a continuous wrapping covering the damaged area. \\\\nThe repair material shall not extend along the length of the blade more than 0.79 in/2.0 cm in each direction \\\\nbeyond the limits of the damaged area.  Where used as a continuous binding, any overlapping shall not \\\\nbreach the maximum of 0.04 in/0.1 cm in total thickness. \\\\nThe use of non-solid material which when dry forms a hard layer more than 0.004 in/0.01 cm in thickness is \\\\nnot permitted. \\\\n1.4.3 Permitted coverings, repair material and toe guards, not exceeding their specified thicknesses, may be \\\\nadditional to the dimensions above, but the bat must still pass through the gauge as described in paragraph \\\\n1.6. \\\\n1.5 Commercial identifications  \\\\nSuch identifications shall comply with the restrictions set out in the Clothing and Equipment Regulations in \\\\nrelation to the size and position of marks and logos. \\\\n1.6 Bat Gauge \\\\nAll bats must meet the specifications defined in clause 5.7.

Other than where expressly stated in this Appendix (or by necessary implication), all relevant Playing \\\\nConditions for the match shall apply to the Super Over. \\\\n1. A Super  Over involves each team facing an over of six balls (unless ended earlier as provided for in \\\\nparagraph 2), and the winner shall be the team scoring the greater number of runs, irrespective of the \\\\nnumber of wickets lost.  \\\\n \\\\n2. The loss of two wickets shall end the batting team’s one over innings. \\\\n \\\\n3. If the Super Over is a tie, subsequent Super Overs shall be played until a winner is determined. Other than \\\\nin exceptional circumstances (as set out in paragraph 25 below), an u nlimited number of Super Ove rs may \\\\nbe played where necessary to determine a result. \\\\n \\\\n4. Subject to weather conditions, the Super Over shall take place on the scheduled day of the match at a time \\\\nto be determined by the ICC Tournament Re feree. In normal circumstances it shall commence 5 minutes \\\\nafter the conclusion of the match. \\\\n \\\\n5. The Super Over shall be played until completion, but if there are any delays or interruptions during the Super \\\\nOver, extra time (taken from the start of the first Super Over) is alloca ted to complete the Super Over or any \\\\nsubsequent Super Overs. The amount of extra time allocated to the Super Over is the greater of; \\\\na) the gap between the time at which the match ended and the time the original match would have been \\\\nscheduled to finish had the entire extra time provision been utilized, or \\\\nb) 20 minutes. \\\\n \\\\n6. Should play be delayed prior to or during the Super Over(s) once the playing time lost exceeds the extra \\\\ntime allocated, the Super Over(s) shall be abandoned (see paragraph 24 below). \\\\n \\\\n7. The Super Over shall take place on t he pitch all ocated for the match, unless otherwise determined by the \\\\numpires in consultation with the Ground Authority and the ICC Tournament Referee. \\\\n \\\\n8. Only nominated players in the match (including Concus sion Replacements) may participate in the Super \\\\nOver.  \\\\n \\\\n9. Any penalty time being served in the match shall be carried forward to the Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n10. The umpires shall stand at the same end at which they finished the match. \\\\n \\\\n11. The team batting second in the match shall bat first in the Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n12. Each Team shall  be allowed one unsuccessful player review per innings per Super Over. This entitlement \\\\nshall apply irrespective of the number of unsuccessful Player Review requests made during the match itself.  \\\\n \\\\n13. The captain of the fielding team (or his nominee) shall select the ball with which the fi elding team shall bowl \\\\nits over in the Super Over from the box of spare balls provided by the umpires (which shall include the balls \\\\nused in the match, but no new balls).  The team fielding second may then choose to use the s ame ball as \\\\nchosen by the team bowling first or choose another ball from the same box. If the ball needs to be changed, \\\\nthe relevant Playing Conditions as they apply in the match shall also apply in the Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n14. The fielding side shall choose the end from which it is to bowl its one over. \\\\n \\\\n15. The Super Over shall be played with the same fielding restrictions as would be applicable for the last over in \\\\nan uninterrupted match. \\\\n83 \\\\n \\\\n16. The interval between the two overs in the Super Over shall be 5 minutes. \\\\n \\\\nTIED SUPER OVER – REPEATING THE SUPER OVER \\\\n \\\\n17. If the Super Over is tied, then subsequent Super Overs shall be played until there is a winner (subject to \\\\nparagraph 25). \\\\n \\\\n18. In normal circumstances any subsequent Super Over shall start 5 minutes after the previous Super Over \\\\nends. \\\\n \\\\n19. The team batting second in the previous Super Over shall bat first in the subsequent Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n20. The balls selected for use by each team in the previous Super Over shall be used again by the same team \\\\nin any subsequent Super Over(s). \\\\n \\\\n21. The fielding side shall bowl its over in a subsequent Super Over from the opposite end from which it bowled \\\\nin the previous Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n22. Any batter dismissed in any previous Super Over shall be ineligible to bat in any subsequent Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n23. Any bowler who bowled in the previous Super Over shall be ineligible to bowl in the subsequent Super Over. \\\\n \\\\n24. In all other ways the procedure for a subsequent Super Over shall be the same as for the initial Super Over. \\\\n \\\\nSUPER OVER UNABLE TO BE COMPLETED \\\\n25. Where the Super Over or subsequent Super Overs are abandoned for any reason prior to completion then \\\\nthe match shall be declared a tie and points allocated as in Clause 16.11.1. \\\\n \\\\n26. In circumstances where there are unavoidable time constraints (for example, a requirement to switch off \\\\nfloodlights at a certain time) which do not allow the completion of multiple Super Overs, the ICC Tournament \\\\nReferee may limit the number of possible Super Overs and shall advise both captains accordingly prior to \\\\nthe start of the first Super Over. \\\\n \\\\nEXAMPLES - EXTRA TIME AVAILABLE FOR THE SUPER OVER \\\\nExample 1: The match is scheduled to finish at 10.20pm, with 60 minutes of extra time available to be used. The \\\\nscheduled cut-off time if all the available extra time is used would be 11.20pm. The match runs over time and finishes \\\\nin a tie  at 10.35pm. The Super Over is scheduled to start 5 minutes later at 10.40pm. The extra time available to \\\\ncomplete the Super Over would be 45 minutes (as per paragraph 5(a) above). \\\\n• The Super Over  starts on time but is inter rupted at 10 .50pm for 10 minutes (leaving 35 minutes of extra time still \\\\navailable). \\\\n• Play resumes at 11.00pm with a tied Super Over occurring. \\\\n• The second super over is being played but is interrupted at 11.15pm. \\\\n• Play does not resume within 35 minutes (being the amount of extra tim e still available), therefore the Super Over \\\\nprocedure is abandoned, and the match is a tie. \\\\nExample 2: The same match is scheduled to finish at 10.20pm, but with 30 minutes of extra time available to be used. \\\\nThe scheduled c ut-off time if all the available extra time is used would be 10.50pm. The match runs over time and \\\\nfinishes in a tie at 10.35pm. The Super Over is scheduled to start 5 minutes later at 10.40pm. The extra t ime \\\\navailable to complete the Super Over would be 20 minutes (as per paragraph 5(b) above). \\\\n84 \\\\nAppendix G \\\\nOn Field Injury Assessments and Treatment \\\\nThe umpires will allow an initial 4 minutes for medical staff to treat the injured player. Umpires may inform the medical \\\\nteam when there is 90 seconds remaining, after which, the player should be removed from the field of play if further \\\\nassessment/treatment is required. The on-field umpires will consider each incident when applying the 4-minute \\\\nguideline and be guided by the appointed Match Day Doctor or his/her nominated replacement. \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n\"}{\\'filename\\': \\'rule_word3.docx\\', \\'text\\': \\'ICC CLASSIFICATION OF OFFICIAL CRICKET WITH EFFECT FROM MARCH 2024 This document provides guidance as to the classification of current and future matches. It is not intended to be applied retrospectively or to lead to changes in classifications made prior to this document becoming effective. 1 TEST MATCHES Test matches are those matches which are played in accordance with the ICC Standard Men’s and Women’s Test Match Playing Conditions and other ICC regulations pertaining to Test matches. Test matches are played between Men’s and Women’s Teams selected by Full Members of the ICC as representative of the Member Countries (Full Member Teams). Note: Matches involving an “A” team or age-group team shall not be classified as Test matches. 2 ONE DAY INTERNATIONALS (ODI) ODI matches are those matches which: a) Are played in accordance with the ICC Standard Men’s and Women’s One Day International Playing Conditions and other ICC regulations pertaining to ODI Matches; and b) Are between: i) Any teams participating in and as part of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup, the Cricket World Cup Qualifier, the Cricket World Cup Qualifier Play-Off, Cricket World Cup League 2, the Men’s Asia Cup, the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup and the Women’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier; or ii) Two Full Member Teams; or iii) A Full Member Team and an Associate Member with ODI status iv) Two Associate Members both with ODI status NOTE: Afghanistan does not have Women’s ODI status. The Associate Members with ODI status are as follows: For Men’s ODIs: Canada, Namibia, Nepal, Oman, Scotland, The Netherlands, United Arab Emirates and United States of America; For Women’s ODIs: The Netherlands, Papua New Guinea, Scotland, Thailand and United States of America Note: The 8 Men’s Associate Member teams listed above shall have ODI status until at least the conclusion of the CWC Qualifier Playoff in 2027. Note: Matches involving an “A” team or age-group team shall not be classified as ODI matches. 3. TWENTY20 INTERNATIONAL MATCHES Twenty20 International Matches are those which: a) Are played in accordance with the ICC Standard Men’s and Women’s Twenty20 International Playing Conditions and other ICC regulations pertaining to Twenty20 International Matches; and b) Are between: i) Any teams participating in and as part of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup and the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup; or ii) Teams both of whom are either Full or Associate Members. Note: Matches involving an “A” team or age-group team shall not be classified as Twenty20 international matches. Performances in Test matches, ODIs or Twenty20 International matches that are abandoned (after the toss) for any reason, including the pitch being considered too dangerous for play to continue, are still recorded in official records. 4 OTHER OFFICIAL INTERNATIONALS Any limited overs match between Associate international teams other than those already classified as ODIs/T20Is. Such matches are only other official internationals if played as part of a global or regional ICC event or competition; or agreed with and under the auspices of the ICC Development Programme/High Performance Programme. Note: These matches, among other things, will always be subject to ICC officials’ arrangements, qualification rules and the ICC approved Code of Conduct and playing conditions. 5 FIRST-CLASS MATCHES First-Class Matches are those men’s and women’s matches of two innings per side and of three or more days’ duration between two sides of eleven players played on natural turf pitches and substantially conforming to ICC standard playing conditions. Full playing replacements – a Full Member may, if it wishes, introduce playing regulations to allow any of the 11 playing members of a side to be changed for any reason after the start of the match without the match forgoing its firstclass status. Concussion substitutes – a player who is diagnosed as concussed, or likely to be concussed, and deemed unable to play any further part in the match may be replaced with a full-playing substitute without the match forgoing its firstclass status. COVID-19 – a player who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 or likely to be suffering from COVID-19 and deemed unable to play any further part in the match, or is prevented from playing any further part in the match as a result of applicable COVID-19 public health guidance, may be replaced with a full playing substitute without the match forgoing its first-class status. In the following Rules, the term “Governing Body” is restricted to Full Members. Rules a) The status of all matches in an official ICC competition shall be decided by the ICC. For matches outside official ICC competitions, b) and c) below shall apply. b) Full Members of the International Cricket Council shall decide the status of matches of three or more days’ duration played in their countries. c) In matches of three or more days’ duration played in countries which are not Full Members of the International Cricket Council: i) if only one team comes from a Full Member country or both teams come from the same Full Member country then that country shall decide the status; otherwise ii) if both teams come from different Full Member countries then the status shall be decided by agreement between those countries if possible; otherwise iii) the ICC shall decide. Note: Governing Bodies agree that the interest of First-Class cricket will be served by ensuring that First-Class status is not accorded to any match in which one or other of the teams taking part cannot on a strict interpretation of the definitions be adjudged First-Class. Matches involving age-group teams up to and including U19 shall not be classified as First-Class matches. Note: Decisions regarding the awarding a match First-Class status should whenever possible be taken and announced by the relevant governing body prior to its commencement, failing which as soon as possible thereafter. Where a decision regarding First-Class status has already been made, including in respect of all matches played prior to these classifications taking effect, any subsequent reversal of a decision (i.e. to upgrade a match to First-Class status or downgrade it from First-Class status) shall be permitted only in exceptional circumstances, and then only with the approval of the ICC. Note: Any known breaches of the above provisions relating to the use of substitutes may result in the match where the breach was committed retrospectively losing its First-Class status. Such a decision on the status of the match where the breach was committed will be taken by the ICC Chief Executives’ Committee (CEC). Note: Performances in first-class matches that are abandoned (after the toss) for any reason, including the pitch being considered too dangerous for play to continue, are still recorded in official records. This classification applies irrespective of any sanctions the Governing Body may choose to apply to the home team or ground authority. 6 FIRST-CLASS STATUS Full Member men’s and women’s matches of three or more days’ duration shall be regarded as First-Class, subject to the provisions of the First-Class match definition being complied with. The list of First-Class cricket matches in Appendix A is not exhaustive and covers tournaments rather than one-off fixtures. It is therefore merely indicative of the matches which would fall into the First-Class definition. 7 LIST A LIMITED OVERS MATCHES Any men’s or women’s ODI, or any men’s or women’s limited overs match scheduled for one day’s duration and of one innings per side with a minimum of 40 overs per side played at least at State, County or Provincial level, or franchise based teams/competitions in a Full Member country or official matches of a touring Full Member representative team against at least State, County or Provincial level teams and accorded the status of List A Limited Overs Match by the relevant Governing Bodies. A match will still be regarded as List A Limited Overs even if reduced by bad weather or for other reasons to fewer than 40 overs per side. In addition, limited overs matches between ‘A’ teams of Associates with ODI status may be accorded List A Limited Overs status by the relevant Governing Body. Note: A Limited Overs match that involves a team from a country that does not have ODI status shall not be classified as a List A Limited Overs Match. 8 LIST A TWENTY20 MATCHES Any men’s or women’s Twenty20 International match, or any limited overs match scheduled for one day’s duration and of one innings per side with a limit of 20 overs per side played at least at State, County or Provincial level, or franchise based teams/competitions in a Full Member country or official matches of a touring Full Member representative team against at least State, County or Provincial level teams and accorded the status of List A Twenty20 Match by the relevant Governing Bodies. In addition, List A T20 status may be granted by the ICC to events that are played by Associate Members who have ODI status. As a guideline, ICC will consider granting List A T20 status if the event requires that any starting XI comprises a maximum of 7 local and/or Associate Member players and a minimum of four Full Member players of established List A standard. In addition, Twenty20 matches between ‘A’ teams of Associates with ODI status may be accorded List A Twenty20 status by the relevant Governing Body. Note: Other than T20 Internationals, a Twenty20 match that involves a team from a country that does not have ODI status shall not be classified as a List A Twenty20 Match. Rules for List A limited overs matches and List A Twenty20 matches a) The status of all matches in an official ICC competition shall be decided by the ICC. For matches outside official ICC competitions, b) and c) below shall apply. b) Full Members of the ICC shall decide the status of matches of one day’s duration played in their countries or in tournaments under their jurisdiction. c) In matches of one day’s duration played in countries which are not Full Members of the ICC: i) if only one team comes from a Full Member country or both teams come from the same Full Member country then that country shall decide the status; otherwise ii) if both teams come from different Full Member countries then the status shall be decided by agreement between those countries if possible; otherwise iii) the ICC shall decide. Note: Performances in men’s and women’s List A matches that are abandoned (after the toss) for any reason, including the pitch being considered too dangerous for play to continue, are still recorded in official records. This classification applies irrespective of any sanctions the Governing Body may choose to apply to the home team or ground authority. Note: It is intended that men’s and women’s List A matches will be those one day matches played at the highest domestic level. Matches that are primarily arranged as festival, friendly or practice matches and outside any competitive structure should not qualify as List A matches. The creation of List A, the definition of List A matches and the application of this definition to all limited overs cricket worldwide was the work of the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (ACS). Prior to 2007, all decisions regarding the classification of Men’s limited overs matches as the one-day counterpart to first-class status were undertaken by the ACS, with no previous involvement from the ICC or national Governing Bodies. Since 2007, the ICC has been responsible for the definition of List A and has placed future classification decisions in the hands of its Full Members. Therefore Full Members are required to determine which limited-overs matches played under their jurisdiction should be accorded List A status. However, the ACS will continue to maintain the list of matches it believes fulfil the criteria for List A with Full Members advising by exception should they wish to add or remove any matches from this list. In order to preserve the integrity of past efforts of the ACS and to ensure the ongoing maintenance of authoritative and consistent records, the following shall apply: a) No attempt will be made by Governing Bodies or the ICC to amend retrospectively the status of Men’s limited-overs matches, i.e. the catalogue of past List A matches compiled over the years by the ACS will be allowed to stand. b) Governing Bodies will wish to ensure that their future List A classifications are consistent with (a) each other, (b) past decisions and (c) the definition of List A as written by the ACS and adopted by the ICC. 9 OTHER MATCHES Other cricket played under the auspices of a Member country may be classified by such Member country as Official Cricket. Including but not limited to: a) Men’s and women’s matches between the “A” teams, National Academy or Age Group Teams of Member countries. b) All other men’s and women’s matches played as part of a competition or tournament held under the auspices of a Member including club cricket, schools, age groups and university cricket. c) Matches between Members that are not covered in the regulations above relating to Test Matches, One Day Internationals, T20 Internationals or Other Official Internationals (these matches are not subject to ICC officials’ arrangements, qualification rules and/or the ICC-approved Code of Conduct and playing conditions). 10 DISPUTES In case of any disputes arising from these Rules, failing unanimous agreement being reached between the disputing parties, the Chief Executive of the ICC shall refer the matter to the ICC Disputes Resolution Committee for its final and binding determination. APPENDIX A INTERNATIONAL STATUS AWARDED BY EXCEPTION The following is a list of circumstances where matches have, by exception, been awarded Test, ODI or T20I status. Test Matches i) A Men’s Full Member Team and a composite team selected by the ICC as representative of the best players from the rest of the world. One Day International Matches (ODIs) i) A Full Member Team (or “top 8” Men’s Associate Member team) and a composite team selected by the ICC as representative of the best players from the rest of the world. Twenty20 International Matches i) Any other matches between a Full Member and a World XI of suitable calibre that the ICC Board, by exception and in advance, decides to award T20I status. ii) Teams participating in and as part of the Women’s event at the Commonwealth Games 2022. FIRST-CLASS STATUS The following men’s matches of three or more days’ duration shall be regarded as First-Class, subject to the provisions of the First-Class match definition being complied with. The list below is not exhaustive and covers tournaments rather than one-off fixtures. It is therefore merely indicative of the matches which would fall into the First-Class definition. i) Test matches ii) Matches by “A” teams of Full Member countries against teams adjudged First-Class (including the “A” team of another Full Member country) iii) In all Full Member Countries Matches against teams adjudged First-Class played by official touring teams iv) In Afghanistan Ahmad Shah Abdali First Class v) In Australia Sheffield Shield matches between states vi) In Bangladesh National Cricket League matches between divisions; and Bangladesh Cricket League matches between zones vii) In England and Wales Matches in the County Championship between counties viii) In India Ranji Trophy matches between states; Duleep Trophy matches between zones; and Irani Cup match between the Ranji Trophy winner and the Rest of India x) In Ireland Inter-Provincial Championship, played between Provincial Unions The Emerald Challenge 4-Day Competition xi) In New Zealand Plunket Shield matches between provinces xii) In Pakistan Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, The President’s Trophy xiii) In South Africa All Provincial 4-day matches in Division 1 and Division 2 xiv) In Sri Lanka Major Tier “A” – 3- or 4-day match National Super League – 3- or 4-day match xv) In West Indies West Indies Championship (WIC) matches between territories/franchises The Headley/Weekes Tournament xvi) In Zimbabwe Logan Cup matches between Provincial sides\\\\n\\'}'"

One of the main cricket rules is that for batsmen to score runs they must run to each other’s end of the pitch (from one end to the other). In doing this one run is scored. Cricket rules state they may run multiple runs per shot. As well as running they can also score runs by hitting boundaries. A boundary scores the batsmen either 4 or 6 runs. A four is scored by hitting the ball past the boundary after hitting the ground while a six is scored by hitting the ball past the boundary on the full (before it hits the ground). Cricket rules also state that once a 4 or 6 has been scored any runs physically ran by the batsman are null & void. They',\n",

Other ways runs can be scored according to the cricket rules include no balls, wide balls & byes. Cricket rules state that all runs scored by these methods are awarded to the batting team but not the individual batters. • A “No Ball” can be declared for many reasons: If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong place, the ball is declared dangerous (often happens when bowled at the batsmen’s body on the full), bounces more than twice or rolls before IM Rules 2021 2 | P a g e reaching the batsman or if fielders are standing in illegal positions.

The batsman gains any runs scored off the no ball for his shot while the team also gains one run for the no ball itself. • A “Wide Ball” will be declared if the umpire thinks the batsman did not have a reasonable opportunity to score off the delivery. However if the delivery is bowled over the batsmen’s head it will not be declared a wide but a no ball. Umpires are much stricter on wide deliveries in the shorter format of the game while being much more relaxed in test cricket.

It does not matter whether the ball has touched the batsman’s bat, gloves, body or any other part of the batsman. However the ball is not allowed to have touched another player or umpire before hitting the wickets. • Caught – Cricket rules state that if a batsman hits the ball or touches the ball at all with his bat or hand/glove holding the bat then the batsman can be caught out. This is done by the fielders, wicket keeper or bowler catching the ball on the full (before it bounces). If this is done then cricket rules state the batsman is out. • Stumped – A batsman can be given out according to cricket rules when the wicketkeeper puts down his wicket while he is out of',\n",

The striking batsman is also out if he hits his wicket down while setting off for his first run. • Handled The Ball – Cricket rules allow the batsman to be given out if he willingly handles the ball with the hand that is not',\n",

If this is not done the incoming batsman can be given out. • Hit The Ball Twice – Cricket rules state that if a batsman hits a ball twice other than for the purpose of protecting his wicket or with consent from the opposition he is out. • Obstructing The Field – A batsman is out if he willingly obstructs the opposition by word or action.\\\\n\\'}{\\'filename\\': \\'woman rules.pdf\\', \\'text\\': \" \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nICC Women’s Test Match Playing Conditions',\n",
